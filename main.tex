\chapter{Introduction to data}
\label{introductionToData}

%\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle[Chapter Goal:]{Thinking about data}
%Understand basics about data organization, data types, numerical summaries of data, graphical summaries of data, and foundational techniques for data collection. We begin and end the chapter with case studies.}
%\end{tipBox}

Scientists seek to answer questions using rigorous methods and careful observations. These observations -- collected from the likes of field notes, surveys, and experiments -- form the backbone of a statistical investigation and are called \term{data}. Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. It is helpful to put statistics in the context of a general process of investigation:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Identify a question or problem.
\item Collect relevant data on the topic.
\item Analyze the data.
\item Form a conclusion.
%\item Make decisions based on the conclusion.
\end{enumerate}

Statistics as a subject focuses on making stages 2-4 objective, rigorous, and efficient. That~is, statistics has three primary components: How best can we collect data? How should it be analyzed? And what can we infer from the analysis?

The topics scientists investigate are as diverse as the questions they ask. However, many of these investigations can be addressed with a small number of data collection techniques, analytic tools, and fundamental concepts in statistical inference. This chapter provides a glimpse into these and other themes we will encounter throughout the rest of the book. We introduce the basic principles of each branch and learn some tools along the way. We will encounter applications from other fields, some of which are not typically associated with science but nonetheless can benefit from statistical study.

\section[Case study: using stents to prevent strokes]{Case study: using stents to prevent strokes \sectionvideohref{youtube-nEHFF1ADpWE&list=PLkIselvEzpM6pZ76FD3NoCvvgkj_p-dE8}}
\label{basicExampleOfStentsAndStrokes}

\index{data!stroke|(}

Section~\ref{basicExampleOfStentsAndStrokes} introduces a classic challenge in statistics: evaluating the efficacy of a medical treatment. Terms in this section, and indeed much of this chapter, will all be revisited later in the text. The plan for now is simply to get a sense of the role statistics can play in practice.

In this section we will consider an experiment that studies effectiveness of stents in treating patients at risk of stroke.\footnote{Chimowitz MI, Lynn MJ, Derdeyn CP, et al. 2011. Stenting versus Aggressive Medical Therapy for Intracranial Arterial Stenosis. New England Journal of Medicine 365:993-1003. \oiRedirect{textbook-nejm_stent_study}{www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1105335}. NY Times article reporting on the study: \oiRedirect{textbook-nytimes_stent_study}{www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/health/research/08stent.html}.} Stents are devices put inside blood vessels that assist in patient recovery after cardiac events and reduce the risk of an additional heart attack or death. Many doctors have hoped that there would be similar benefits for patients at risk of stroke. We start by writing the principal question the researchers hope to answer:
\begin{quote}
Does the use of stents reduce the risk of stroke?
\end{quote}

The researchers who asked this question collected data on 451 at-risk patients. Each volunteer patient was randomly assigned to one of two groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item[]\termsub{Treatment group}{treatment group}. Patients in the treatment group received a stent and medical management. The medical management included medications, management of risk factors, and help in lifestyle modification.
\item[]\termsub{Control group}{control group}. Patients in the control group received the same medical management as the treatment group, but they did not receive stents.
\end{itemize}
Researchers randomly assigned 224 patients to the treatment group and 227 to the control group. In this study, the control group provides a reference point against which we can measure the medical impact of stents in the treatment group.

Researchers studied the effect of stents at two time points: 30~days after enrollment and 365~days after enrollment. The results of 5 patients are summarized in Table~\ref{stentStudyResultsDF}. Patient outcomes are recorded as ``stroke'' or ``no event'', representing whether or not the patient had a stroke at the end of a time period.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l ccc}
\hline
Patient	&	group	&	0-30 days 	&	0-365 days \\
\hline
1		&	treatment &	no event &	no event \\
2		&	treatment &	stroke & stroke \\
3		&	treatment &	no event & no event \\
$\vdots$	&	$\vdots$	  &	$\vdots$ \\
450	&	control &	no event &	no event \\
451	&	control &	no event &	no event \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Results for five patients from the stent study.}
\label{stentStudyResultsDF}
% trmt <- c(rep('trmt', 224), rep('control', 227)); outcome30 <- c(rep(c('event', 'no_event'), c(33, 191)), rep(c('event', 'no_event'), c(13, 214))); outcome365 <- c(rep(c('event', 'no_event'), c(33, 191)), rep(c('event', 'no_event'), c(13, 214)))
\end{table}

Considering data from each patient individually would be a long, cumbersome path towards answering the original research question. Instead, performing a statistical data analysis allows us to consider all of the data at once. Table~\ref{stentStudyResults} summarizes the raw data in a more helpful way. In this table, we can quickly see what happened over the entire study. For instance, to identify the number of patients in the treatment group who had a stroke within 30 days, we look on the left-side of the table at the intersection of the treatment and stroke: 33.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l cc c cc}
& \multicolumn{2}{c}{0-30 days} &\hspace{5mm}\ & \multicolumn{2}{c}{0-365 days} \\
  \cline{2-3} \cline{5-6}
	& 	stroke 	& no event && 	stroke 	& no event \\
  \hline

control 		& 13		& 214	&& 	28	& 199 \\
  \hline
Total				& 46		& 405	&&	73	& 378 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Descriptive statistics for the stent study.}
\label{stentStudyResults}
\end{table}

\begin{exercise}
Of the 224 patients in the treatment group, 45 had a stroke by the end of the first year. Using these two numbers, compute the proportion of patients in the treatment group who had a stroke by the end of their first year. (Please note: answers to all Guided Practice exercises are provided using footnotes.)\footnote{The proportion of the 224 patients who had a stroke within 365 days: $45/224 = 0.20$.}
\end{exercise}

We can compute summary statistics from the table. A \term{summary statistic} is a single number summarizing a large amount of data.\footnote{Formally, a summary statistic is a value computed from the data. Some summary statistics are more useful than others.} For instance, the primary results of the study after 1~year could be described by two summary statistics: the proportion of people who had a stroke in the treatment and control groups.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[] Proportion who had a stroke in the treatment (stent) group: $45/224 = 0.20 = 20\%$.
\item[] Proportion who had a stroke in the control group: $28/227 = 0.12 = 12\%$.
\end{itemize}
These two summary statistics are useful in looking for differences in the groups, and we are in for a surprise: an additional 8\% of patients in the treatment group had a stroke! This is important for two reasons. First, it is contrary to what doctors expected, which was that stents would \emph{reduce} the rate of strokes. Second, it leads to a statistical question: do the data show a ``real'' difference between the groups?

This second question is subtle. Suppose you flip a coin 100 times. While the chance a coin lands heads in any given coin flip is 50\%, we probably won't observe exactly 50 heads. This type of fluctuation is part of almost any type of data generating process. It is possible that the 8\% difference in the stent study is due to this natural variation. However, the larger the difference we observe (for a particular sample size), the less believable it is that the difference is due to chance. So what we are really asking is the following: is the difference so large that we should reject the notion that it was due to chance?

While we don't yet have our statistical tools to fully address this question on our own, we can comprehend the conclusions of the published analysis: there was compelling evidence of harm by stents in this study of stroke patients.

\textbf{Be careful:} do not generalize the results of this study to all patients and all stents. This study looked at patients with very specific characteristics who volunteered to be a part of this study and who may not be representative of all stroke patients. In addition, there are many types of stents and this study only considered the self-expanding Wingspan stent (Boston Scientific). However, this study does leave us with an important lesson: we should keep our eyes open for surprises.

\label{dataBasics}

Effective presentation and description of data is a first step in most analyses. This section introduces one structure for organizing data as well as some terminology that will be used throughout this book.

\subsection{Observations, variables, and data matrices}

\index{data!email50|(}

Table~\ref{email50DF} displays rows 1, 2, 3, and 50 of a data set concerning 50 emails received during early 2012. These observations will be referred to as the \data{email50} data set, and they are a random sample from a larger data set that we will see in Section~\ref{categoricalData}.

Each row in the table represents a single email or \term{case}.\footnote{A case is also sometimes called a \term{unit of observation} or an \term{observational unit}.} The columns represent characteristics, called \termsub{variables}{variable}, for each of the emails. For example, the first row represents email 1, which is a not spam, contains 21,705 characters, 551 line breaks, is written in HTML format, and contains only small numbers.

In practice, it is especially important to ask clarifying questions to ensure important aspects of the data are understood. For instance, it is always important to be sure we know what each variable means and the units of measurement. Descriptions of all five email variables are given in Table~\ref{email50Variables}.

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cc ccc c}
  \hline

\var{format} & Indicates if the email contained special formatting, such as bolding, tables, or links, which would indicate the message is in HTML format    \\
\var{number} & Indicates whether the email contained no number, a small number (under 1 million), or a large number   \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Variables and their descriptions for the \data{email50} data set.\textC{\vspace{-3.5mm}}}
\label{email50Variables}
\end{table}

\index{data!email50|)}

The data in Table~\ref{email50DF} represent a \term{data matrix}, which is a common way to organize data. Each row of a data matrix corresponds to a unique case, and each column corresponds to a variable. A data matrix for the stroke study introduced in Section~\ref{basicExampleOfStentsAndStrokes} is shown in Table~\vref{stentStudyResultsDF}, where the cases were patients and there were three variables recorded for each patient.

Data matrices are a convenient way to record and store data. If another individual or case is added to the data set, an additional row can be easily added. Similarly, another column can be added for a new variable.

\index{data!county|(}

\begin{exercise}
We consider a publicly available data set that summarizes information about the 3,143 counties in the United States, and we call this the \data{county} data set. This data set includes information about each county: its name, the state where it resides, its population in 2000 and 2010, per capita federal spending, poverty rate, and five additional characteristics. How might these data be organized in a data matrix? Reminder: look in the footnotes for answers to in-text exercises.\footnote{Each county may be viewed as a case, and there are eleven pieces of information recorded for each case. A table with 3,143 rows and 11 columns could hold these data, where each row represents a county and each column represents a particular piece of information.}
\end{exercise}

\noindent Seven rows of the \data{county} data set are shown in Table~\ref{countyDF}, and the variables are summarized in Table~\ref{countyVariables}. These data were collected from the US Census website.\footnote{\oiRedirect{textbook-census_quick_facts}{quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/index.html}}

\subsection{Types of variables}
\label{variableTypes}

Examine the \var{fed\_\hspace{0.3mm}spend}, \var{pop2010}, \var{state}, and \var{smoking\_\hspace{0.3mm}ban} variables in the \data{county} data set. Each of these variables is inherently different from the other three yet many of them share certain characteristics.

First consider \var{fed\_\hspace{0.3mm}spend}, which is said to be a \term{numerical} variable since it can take a wide range of numerical values, and it is sensible to add, subtract, or take averages with those values. On the other hand, we would not classify a variable reporting telephone area codes as numerical since their average, sum, and difference have no clear meaning.

The \var{pop2010} variable is also numerical, although it seems to be a little different than \var{fed\_\hspace{0.3mm}spend}. This variable of the population count can only take whole non-negative numbers (\resp{0}, \resp{1}, \resp{2}, ...). For this reason, the population variable is said to be \term{discrete} since it can only take numerical values with jumps. On the other hand, the federal spending variable is said to be \term{continuous}.

The variable \var{state} can take up to 51 values after accounting for Washington, DC: \resp{AL}, ..., and \resp{WY}. Because the responses themselves are categories, \var{state} is called a \term{categorical} variable, and the possible values are called the variable's \term{levels}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.57\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/variables/variables}
\caption{Breakdown of variables into their respective types.}
\label{variables}
\end{figure}

Finally, consider the \var{smoking\_\hspace{0.3mm}ban} variable, which describes the type of county-wide smoking ban and takes values \resp{none}, \resp{partial}, or \resp{comprehensive} in each county. This variable seems to be a hybrid: it is a categorical variable but the levels have a natural ordering. A variable with these properties is called an \term{ordinal} variable, while a regular categorical variable without this type of special ordering is called a \term{nominal} variable. To simplify analyses, any ordinal variables in this book will be treated as categorical variables.

\begin{example}{Data were collected about students in a statistics course. Three variables were recorded for each student: number of siblings, student height, and whether the student had previously taken a statistics course. Classify each of the variables as continuous numerical, discrete numerical, or categorical.}
The number of siblings and student height represent numerical variables. Because the number of siblings is a count, it is discrete. Height varies continuously, so it is a continuous numerical variable. The last variable classifies students into two categories -- those who have and those who have not taken a statistics course -- which makes this variable categorical.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise} \index{data!stroke}
Consider the variables \var{group} and \var{outcome} (at 30 days) from the stent study in Section~\ref{basicExampleOfStentsAndStrokes}. Are these numerical or categorical variables?\footnote{There are only two possible values for each variable, and in both cases they describe categories. Thus, each is a categorical variable.}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Relationships between variables}
\label{variableRelations}

Many analyses are motivated by a researcher looking for a relationship between two or more variables. A social scientist may like to answer some of the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[(1)]\label{fedSpendingPovertyQuestion} Is federal spending, on average, higher or lower in counties with high rates of poverty?
\item[(2)]\label{ownershipMultiUnitQuestion} If homeownership is lower than the national average in one county, will the percent of multi-unit structures in that county likely be above or below the national average?
\item[(3)]\label{isAverageIncomeAssociatedWithSmokingBans} Which counties have a higher average income: those that enact one or more smoking bans or those that do not?
\end{enumerate}

To answer these questions, data must be collected, such as the \data{county} data set shown in Table~\ref{countyDF}. Examining summary statistics \index{summary statistic} could provide insights for each of the three questions about counties. Additionally, graphs can be used to visually summarize data and are useful for answering such questions as well.

\indexthis{Scatterplots}{scatterplot} are one type of graph used to study the relationship between two numerical variables. Figure~\ref{county_fed_spendVsPoverty} compares the variables \var{fed\_\hspace{0.3mm}spend} and \var{poverty}. Each point on the plot represents a single county. For instance, the highlighted dot corresponds to County~1088 in the \data{county} data set: Owsley County, Kentucky, which had a poverty rate of 41.5\% and federal spending of \$21.50 per capita. The scatterplot suggests a relationship between the two variables: counties with a high poverty rate also tend to have slightly more federal spending. We might brainstorm as to why this relationship exists and investigate each idea to determine which is the most reasonable explanation.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/county_fed_spendVsPoverty/county_fed_spendVsPoverty}

\label{county_fed_spendVsPoverty}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
Examine the variables in the \data{email50} data set, which are described in Table~\vref{email50Variables}. Create two questions about the relationships between these variables that are of interest to you.\footnote{Two sample questions: (1) Intuition suggests that if there are many line breaks in an email then there also would tend to be many characters: does this hold true? (2)~Is there a connection between whether an email format is plain text (versus HTML) and whether it is a spam message?}
\end{exercise}

The \var{fed\_\hspace{0.3mm}spend} and \var{poverty} variables are said to be associated because the plot shows a discernible pattern. When two variables show some connection with one another, they are called \term{associated} variables. Associated variables can also be called \term{dependent} variables and vice-versa.

\begin{example}{This example examines the relationship between homeownership and the percent of units in multi-unit structures (e.g. apartments, condos), which is visualized using a scatterplot in Figure~\ref{multiunitsVsOwnership}. Are these variables associated?}
It appears that the larger the fraction of units in multi-unit structures, the lower the homeownership rate. Since there is some relationship between the variables, they are associated.
\end{example}


\begin{figure}

   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/multiunitsVsOwnership/multiunitsVsOwnership}

Interested readers may find an image of this plot with an additional third variable, county population, presented at \oiRedirect{textbook-homeownership_vs_multi_unit_structures}{www.openintro.org/stat/down/MHP.png}.}
   \label{multiunitsVsOwnership}
\end{figure}

Because there is a downward trend in Figure~\ref{multiunitsVsOwnership} -- counties with more units in multi-unit structures are associated with lower homeownership -- these variables are said to be \termsub{negatively associated}{negative association}. A \term{positive association} is shown in the relationship between the \var{poverty} and \var{fed\_\hspace{0.3mm}spend} variables represented in Figure~\ref{county_fed_spendVsPoverty}, where counties with higher poverty rates tend to receive more federal spending per capita.

If two variables are not associated, then they are said to be \term{independent}. That is, two variables are independent if there is no evident relationship between the two.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Associated or independent, not both}
A pair of variables are either related in some way (associated) or not (independent). No pair of variables is both associated and independent.}

\label{overviewOfDataCollectionPrinciples}

\index{sample|(}
\index{population|(}

The first step in conducting research is to identify topics or questions that are to be investigated. A clearly laid out research question is helpful in identifying what subjects or cases should be studied and what variables are important. It is also important to consider \emph{how} data are collected so that they are reliable and help achieve the research goals.

\subsection{Populations and samples}
\label{populationsAndSamples}

Consider the following three research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item What is the average mercury content in swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean?
\item\label{timeToGraduationQuestionForUCLAStudents} Over the last 5 years, what is the average time to complete a degree for Duke undergraduate students?
\item\label{identifyPopulationOfStentStudy} Does a new drug reduce the number of deaths in patients with severe heart disease?
\end{enumerate}
Each research question refers to a target \term{population}. In the first question, the target population is all swordfish in the Atlantic ocean, and each fish represents a case. Often times, it is too expensive to collect data for every case in a population. Instead, a sample is taken. A \term{sample} represents a subset of the cases and is often a small fraction of the population. For instance, 60 swordfish (or some other number) in the population might be selected, and this sample data may be used to provide an estimate of the population average and answer the research question.

\begin{exercise} \label{identifyingThePopulationForTwoQuestionsInPopAndSampSubsection}
For the second and third questions above, identify the target population and what represents an individual case.\footnote{(\ref{timeToGraduationQuestionForUCLAStudents}) Notice that the first question is only relevant to students who complete their degree; the average cannot be computed using a student who never finished her degree. Thus, only Duke undergraduate students who have graduated in the last five years represent cases in the population under consideration. Each such student would represent an individual case. (\ref{identifyPopulationOfStentStudy}) A person with severe heart disease represents a case. The population includes all people with severe heart disease.}
\end{exercise}


\subsection{Anecdotal evidence}
\label{anecdotalEvidenceSubsection}

Consider the following possible responses to the three research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A man on the news got mercury poisoning from eating swordfish, so the average mercury concentration in swordfish must be dangerously high.
\item\label{iKnowThreeStudentsWhoTookMoreThan7YearsToGraduateAtDuke} I met two students who took more than 7 years to graduate from Duke, so it must take longer to graduate at Duke than at many other colleges.
\item\label{myFriendsDadDiedAfterSulphinpyrazon} My friend's dad had a heart attack and died after they gave him a new heart disease drug, so the drug must not work.
\end{enumerate}
Each conclusion is based on data. However, there are two problems. First, the data only represent one or two cases. Second, and more importantly, it is unclear whether these cases are actually representative of the population. Data collected in this haphazard fashion are called \term{anecdotal evidence}.

\setlength{\captionwidth}{\textwidth-80mm}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\hspace{8mm}\includegraphics[width=55mm]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/mnWinter/mnWinter}\hspace{4mm}
\begin{minipage}[b]{\textwidth - 80mm}
   \caption[anecdotal evidence]{In February 2010, some media pundits cited one large snow storm as valid evidence against global warming. As comedian Jon Stewart pointed out, ``It's one storm, in one region, of one country.''
   \label{mnWinter}}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\setlength{\captionwidth}{\mycaptionwidth}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Anecdotal evidence}
Be careful of data collected in a haphazard fashion. Such evidence may be true and verifiable, but it may only represent extraordinary cases.}
\end{termBox}

Anecdotal evidence typically is composed of unusual cases that we recall based on their striking characteristics. For instance, we are more likely to remember the two people we met who took 7 years to graduate than the six others who graduated in four years. Instead of looking at the most unusual cases, we should examine a sample of many cases that represent the population.

\subsection{Sampling from a population}

\index{sample!random sample|(}

We might try to estimate the time to graduation for Duke undergraduates in the last 5 years by collecting a sample of students. All graduates in the last 5 years represent the \emph{population}\index{population}, and graduates who are selected for review are collectively called the \emph{sample}\index{sample}. In general, we always seek to \emph{randomly} select a sample from a population. The most basic type of random selection is equivalent to how raffles are conducted. For example, in selecting graduates, we could write each graduate's name on a raffle ticket and draw 100 tickets. The selected names would represent a random sample of 100 graduates.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/popToSample/popToSampleGraduates}
\caption{In this graphic, five graduates are randomly selected from the population to be included in the sample.}
\label{popToSampleGraduates}
\end{figure}

Why pick a sample randomly? Why not just pick a sample by hand? Consider the following scenario.

\begin{example}{Suppose we ask a student who happens to be majoring in nutrition to select several graduates for the study. What kind of students do you think she might collect? Do you think her sample would be representative of all graduates?}
Perhaps she would pick a disproportionate number of graduates from health-related fields. Or perhaps her selection would be well-representative of the population. When selecting samples by hand, we run the risk of picking a \emph{biased} sample, even if that bias is unintentional or difficult to discern.
\end{example}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/popToSample/popToSubSampleGraduates}
\caption{Instead of sampling from all graduates equally, a nutrition major might inadvertently pick graduates with health-related majors disproportionately often.}
\label{popToSubSampleGraduates}
\end{figure}

If someone was permitted to pick and choose exactly which graduates were included in the sample, it is entirely possible that the sample could be skewed to that person's interests, which may be entirely unintentional. This introduces \term{bias} into a sample. Sampling randomly helps resolve this problem. The most basic random sample is called a \term{simple random sample}, and which is equivalent to using a raffle to select cases. This means that each case in the population has an equal chance of being included and there is no implied connection between the cases in the sample.

\APVersion{Sometimes a simple random sample is difficult to implement and an alternative method is helpful. One such substitute is a \term{systematic sample}, where one case is sampled after letting a fixed number of others, say 10 other cases, pass by. Since this approach uses a mechanism that is not easily subject to personal biases, it often yields a reasonably representative sample. This book will focus on random samples since the use of systematic samples is uncommon and requires additional considerations of the context.}{}

The act of taking a simple random sample helps minimize bias, however, bias can crop up in other ways.
Even when people are picked at random, e.g. for surveys, caution must be exercised if the \term{non-response} \index{sample!non-response|textbf} is high. For instance, if only 30\% of the people randomly sampled for a survey actually respond, then it is unclear whether the results are \term{representative} of the entire population. This \term{non-response bias} \index{sample!non-response bias|textbf} can skew results.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/popToSample/surveySample}
\caption{Due to the possibility of non-response, surveys studies may only reach a certain group within the population. It is difficult, and often times impossible, to completely fix this problem.}
\label{surveySample}
\end{figure}

Another common downfall is a \term{convenience sample}\index{sample!convenience sample}, where individuals who are easily accessible are more likely to be included in the sample. For instance, if a political survey is done by stopping people walking in the Bronx, this will not represent all of New York City. It is often difficult to discern what sub-population a convenience sample represents.

\begin{exercise}
We can easily access ratings for products, sellers, and companies through websites. These ratings are based only on those people who go out of their way to provide a rating. If 50\% of online reviews for a product are negative, do you think this means that 50\% of buyers are dissatisfied with the product?\footnote{Answers will vary. From our own anecdotal experiences, we believe people tend to rant more about products that fell below expectations than rave about those that perform as expected. For this reason, we suspect there is a negative bias in product ratings on sites like Amazon. However, since our experiences may not be representative, we also keep an open mind.}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Explanatory and response variables}
\label{explanatoryAndResponse}

\index{data!county|(}

Consider the following question from page~\pageref{fedSpendingPovertyQuestion} for the \data{county} data set:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] 
	Is federal spending, on average, higher or lower in counties with high rates of poverty?
\end{enumerate}
If we suspect poverty might affect spending in a county, then poverty is the \term{explanatory} variable and federal spending is the \term{response} variable in the relationship.\footnote{Sometimes the explanatory variable is called the \term{independent} variable and the response variable is called the \term{dependent} variable. However, this becomes confusing since a \emph{pair} of variables might be independent or dependent, so we avoid this language.} If there are many variables, it may be possible to consider a number of them as explanatory variables.

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Explanatory and response variables}
To identify the explanatory variable in a pair of variables, identify which of the two is suspected of affecting the other and plan an appropriate analysis.

\hspace{10mm}\includegraphics[height=0.34in]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/expResp/expResp}}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{caution}{association does not imply causation}{Labeling variables as \emph{explanatory} and \emph{response} does not guarantee the relationship between the two is actually causal, even if there is an association identified between the two variables. We use these labels only to keep track of which variable we suspect affects the other.}
\end{caution}

In some cases, there is no explanatory or response variable. Consider the following question from page~\pageref{ownershipMultiUnitQuestion}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(2)] 
	If homeownership is lower than the national average in one county, will the percent of multi-unit structures in that county likely be above or below the national average?
\end{enumerate}
It is difficult to decide which of these variables should be considered the explanatory and response variable, i.e. the direction is ambiguous, so no explanatory or response labels are suggested here.

\index{data!county|)}

\subsection{Introducing observational studies and experiments}

There are two primary types of data collection: observational studies and experiments.

Researchers perform an \term{observational study} when they collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise. For instance, researchers may collect information via surveys, review medical or company records, or follow a \term{cohort} of many similar individuals to study why certain diseases might develop. In each of these situations, researchers merely observe the data that arise. In general, observational studies can provide evidence of a naturally occurring association between variables, but they cannot by themselves show a causal connection.

When researchers want to investigate the possibility of a causal connection, they conduct an \term{experiment}. Usually there will be both an explanatory and a response variable. For instance, we may suspect administering a drug will reduce mortality in heart attack patients over the following year. To check if there really is a causal connection between the explanatory variable and the response, researchers will collect a sample of individuals and split them into groups. The individuals in each group are \emph{assigned} a treatment. When individuals are randomly assigned to a group, the experiment is called a \term{randomized experiment}. For example, each heart attack patient in the drug trial could be randomly assigned,  perhaps by flipping a coin, into one of two groups: the first group receives a \term{placebo} (fake treatment) and the second group receives the drug. See the case study in Section~\ref{basicExampleOfStentsAndStrokes} for another example of an experiment, though that study did not employ a placebo.

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{association $\neq$ causation}
In general, association does not imply causation, and causation can only be inferred from a randomized experiment.}
\end{tipBox}

\subsection{Observational studies}

Generally, data in observational studies are collected only by monitoring what occurs, while experiments require the primary explanatory variable in a study be assigned for each subject by the researchers.

Making causal conclusions based on experiments is often reasonable. However, making the same causal conclusions based on observational data can be treacherous and is not recommended. Thus, observational studies are generally only sufficient to show associations.

\begin{exercise} \label{sunscreenLurkingExample}
Suppose an observational study tracked sunscreen use and skin cancer, and it was found that the more sunscreen someone used, the more likely the person was to have skin cancer. Does this mean sunscreen \emph{causes} skin cancer?\footnote{No. See the paragraph following the exercise for an explanation.}
\end{exercise}

Some previous research tells us that using sunscreen actually reduces skin cancer risk, so maybe there is another variable that can explain this hypothetical association between sunscreen usage and skin cancer. One important piece of information that is absent is sun exposure. If someone is out in the sun all day, she is more likely to use sunscreen \emph{and} more likely to get skin cancer. Exposure to the sun is unaccounted for in the simple investigation.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=1.0in]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/variables/sunCausesCancer}
\end{center}
% Some studies:
% http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673698121682
% http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/122/5/537
% Study with a similar scenario to that described here:
% http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.22745/full

Sun exposure is what is called a \term{confounding variable},\footnote{Also called a \term{lurking variable}, \term{confounding factor}, or a \term{confounder}.} which is a variable that is correlated with both the explanatory and response variables. While one method to justify making causal conclusions from observational studies is to exhaust the search for confounding variables, there is no guarantee that all confounding variables can be examined or measured.

In the same way, the \data{county} data set is an observational study with confounding variables, and its data cannot easily be used to make causal conclusions.

\begin{exercise}
Figure~\ref{multiunitsVsOwnership} shows a negative association between the homeownership rate and the percentage of multi-unit structures in a county. However, it is unreasonable to conclude that there is a causal relationship between the two variables. Suggest one or more other variables that might explain the relationship visible in Figure~\ref{multiunitsVsOwnership}.\footnote{Answers will vary. Population density may be important. If a county is very dense, then this may require a larger fraction of residents to live in multi-unit structures. Additionally, the high density may contribute to increases in property value, making homeownership infeasible for many residents.}
\end{exercise}

Observational studies come in two forms: prospective and retrospective studies. A \term{prospective study} identifies individuals and collects information as events unfold. For instance, medical researchers may identify and follow a group of similar individuals over many years to assess the possible influences of behavior on cancer risk. One example of such a study is The Nurses' Health Study, started in 1976 and expanded in 1989.\footnote{\oiRedirect{textbook-channing_nurse_study}{www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs}} This prospective study recruits registered nurses and then collects data from them using questionnaires. \termsub{Retrospective studies}{retrospective studies} collect data after events have taken place, e.g. researchers may review past events in medical records. Some data sets, such as \data{county}, may contain both prospectively- and retrospectively-collected variables. Local governments prospectively collect some variables as events unfolded (e.g. retails sales) while the federal government retrospectively collected others during the 2010 census (e.g. county population counts).

\subsection{Four sampling methods (special topic)}
\label{fourSamplingMethods}
\label{threeSamplingMethods}

Almost all statistical methods are based on the notion of implied randomness. If observational data are not collected in a random framework from a population, these statistical methods -- the estimates and errors associated with the estimates -- are not reliable. Here we consider four random sampling techniques: simple, stratified, cluster, and multistage sampling. Figures~\ref{simple_stratified} and~\ref{cluster_multistage} provide graphical representations of these techniques.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/samplingMethodsFigure/simple_stratified}
\caption{Examples of simple random\index{sample!simple random sampling} and stratified sampling\index{sample!stratified sampling}. In the top panel, simple random sampling was used to randomly select the 18 cases. In the bottom panel, stratified sampling was used: cases were grouped into strata, then simple random sampling was employed within \mbox{each stratum}.}
\label{simple_stratified}
\end{figure}

\termsub{Simple random sampling}{sample!simple random sampling} is probably the most intuitive form of random sampling. Consider the salaries of Major League Baseball (MLB) players, where each player is a member of one of the league's 30 teams. To take a simple random sample of 120 baseball players and their salaries from the 2010 season, we could write the names of that season's 828 players onto slips of paper, drop the slips into a bucket, shake the bucket around until we are sure the names are all mixed up, then draw out slips until we have the sample of 120 players. In general, a sample is referred to as ``simple random'' if each case in the population has an equal chance of being included in the final sample \emph{and} knowing that a case is included in a sample does not provide useful information about which other cases are included.

\termsub{Stratified sampling}{sample!stratified sampling} is a divide-and-conquer sampling strategy. The population is divided into groups called \term{strata}\index{sample!strata|textbf}. The strata are chosen so that similar cases are grouped together, then a second sampling method, usually simple random sampling, is employed within each stratum. In the baseball salary example, the teams could represent the strata, since some teams have a lot more money (up to 4~times as much!). Then we might randomly sample 4 players from each team for a total of 120 players.

Stratified sampling is especially useful when the cases in each stratum are very similar with respect to the outcome of interest. The downside is that analyzing data from a stratified sample is a more complex task than analyzing data from a simple random sample. The analysis methods introduced in this book would need to be extended to analyze data collected using stratified sampling.

\begin{example}{Why would it be good for cases within each stratum to be very similar?}
We might get a more stable estimate for the subpopulation in a stratum if the cases are very similar. These improved estimates for each subpopulation will help us build a reliable estimate for the full population.
\end{example}

In a \termsub{cluster sample}{sample!cluster sample}, we break up the population into many groups, called \termsub{clusters}{sample!cluster}. Then we sample a fixed number of clusters and include all observations from each of those clusters in the sample. A \termsub{multistage sample}{sample!multistage sample} is like a cluster sample, but rather than keeping all observations in each cluster, we collect a random sample within each selected cluster. %Multistage sampling is similar to stratified sampling in its process, except that stratified sampling requires observations be sampled from \emph{every} stratum.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/samplingMethodsFigure/cluster_multistage}
\caption{Examples of cluster\index{sample!cluster sampling} and multistage sampling\index{sample!multistage sampling}. In the top panel, cluster sampling was used. Here, data were binned into nine clusters, three of these clusters were sampled, and all observations within these three cluster were included in the sample. In the bottom panel, multistage sampling was used.
It differs from cluster sampling in that of the clusters selected, we randomly select a subset of each cluster to be included in the sample.}
\label{cluster_multistage}
\end{figure}

Sometimes cluster or multistage sampling can be more economical than the alternative sampling techniques. Also, unlike stratified sampling, these approaches are most helpful when there is a lot of case-to-case variability within a cluster but the clusters themselves don't look very different from one another. For example, if neighborhoods represented clusters, then cluster or multistage sampling work best when the neighborhoods are very diverse. A downside of these methods is that more advanced analysis techniques are typically required, though the methods in this book can be extended to handle such data.

\begin{example}{Suppose we are interested in estimating the malaria rate in a densely tropical portion of rural Indonesia. We learn that there are 30 villages in that part of the Indonesian jungle, each more or less similar to the next. Our goal is to test 150 individuals for malaria. What sampling method should be employed?}
A simple random sample would likely draw individuals from all 30 villages, which could make data collection extremely expensive. Stratified sampling would be a challenge since it is unclear how we would build strata of similar individuals. However, cluster sampling or multistage sampling seem like very good ideas. If we decided to use multistage sampling, we might randomly select half of the villages, then randomly select 10 people from each. This would probably reduce our data collection costs substantially in comparison to a simple random sample, and this approach would still give us reliable information.
\end{example}

\section[Experiments]{Experiments \sectionvideohref{youtube-g7JGe_ykB3I&list=PLkIselvEzpM6pZ76FD3NoCvvgkj_p-dE8}}
\label{experimentsSection}

Studies where the researchers assign treatments to cases are called \termsub{experiments}{experiment}. When this assignment includes randomization, e.g.~using a coin flip to decide which treatment a patient receives, it is called a \term{randomized experiment}. Randomized experiments are fundamentally important when trying to show a causal connection between two variables.

\subsection{Principles of experimental design}
\label{experimentalDesignPrinciples}

Randomized experiments are generally built on four principles.
\begin{description}
\item[Controlling.] Researchers assign treatments to cases, and they do their best to \term{control} any other differences in the groups. For example, when patients take a drug in pill form, some patients take the pill with only a sip of water while others may have it with an entire glass of water. To control for the effect of water consumption, a doctor may ask all patients to drink a 12 ounce glass of water with the pill.
\item[Randomization.] Researchers randomize patients into treatment groups to account for variables that cannot be controlled. For example, some patients may be more susceptible to a disease than others due to their dietary habits. Randomizing patients into the treatment or control group helps even out such differences, and it also prevents accidental bias from entering the study.
\item[Replication.] The more cases researchers observe, the more accurately they can estimate the effect of the explanatory variable on the response. In a single study, we \term{replicate} by collecting a sufficiently large sample. Additionally, a group of scientists may replicate an entire study to verify an earlier finding.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.78\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/figureShowingBlocking/figureShowingBlocking}
\caption{Blocking using a variable depicting patient risk. Patients are first divided into low-risk and high-risk blocks, then each block is evenly separated into the treatment groups using randomization. This strategy ensures an equal representation of patients in each treatment group from both the low-risk and high-risk categories.}
\label{figureShowingBlocking}
\end{figure}

\item[Blocking.] Researchers sometimes know or suspect that variables, other than the treatment, influence the response. Under these circumstances, they may first group individuals based on this variable into \term{blocks} and then randomize cases within each block to the treatment groups. This strategy is often referred to as \term{blocking}. For instance, if we are looking at the effect of a drug on heart attacks, we might first split patients in the study into low-risk and high-risk blocks, then randomly assign half the patients from each block to the control group and the other half to the treatment group, as shown in Figure~\ref{figureShowingBlocking}. This strategy ensures each treatment group has an equal number of low-risk and high-risk patients.
\end{description}

It is important to incorporate the first three experimental design principles into any study, and this book describes applicable methods for analyzing data from such experiments. Blocking is a slightly more advanced technique, and statistical methods in this book may be extended to analyze data collected using blocking.

\subsection{Reducing bias in human experiments}
\label{biasInHumanExperiments}

Randomized experiments are the gold standard for data collection, but they do not ensure an unbiased perspective into the cause and effect relationships in all cases. Human studies are perfect examples where bias can unintentionally arise. Here we reconsider a study where a new drug was used to treat heart attack patients.\footnote{Anturane Reinfarction Trial Research Group. 1980. Sulfinpyrazone in the prevention of sudden death after myocardial infarction. New England Journal of Medicine 302(5):250-256.} In particular, researchers wanted to know if the drug reduced deaths in patients.

These researchers designed a randomized experiment because they wanted to draw causal conclusions about the drug's effect. Study volunteers\footnote{Human subjects are often called \term{patients}, \term{volunteers}, or \term{study participants}.} were randomly placed into two study groups. One group, the \term{treatment group}, received the drug. The other group, called the \term{control group}, did not receive any drug treatment.

Put yourself in the place of a person in the study. If you are in the treatment group, you are given a fancy new drug that you anticipate will help you. On the other hand, a person in the other group doesn't receive the drug and sits idly, hoping her participation doesn't increase her risk of death. These perspectives suggest there are actually two effects: the one of interest is the effectiveness of the drug, and the second is an emotional effect that is difficult to quantify.

Researchers aren't usually interested in the emotional effect, which might bias the study. To circumvent this problem, researchers do not want patients to know which group they are in. When researchers keep the patients uninformed about their treatment, the study is said to be \term{blind}. But there is one problem: if a patient doesn't receive a treatment, she will know she is in the control group. The solution to this problem is to give fake treatments to patients in the control group. A fake treatment is called a \term{placebo}, and an effective placebo is the key to making a study truly blind. A classic example of a placebo is a sugar pill that is made to look like the actual treatment pill. Often times, a placebo results in a slight but real improvement in patients. This effect has been dubbed the \term{placebo~effect}.

The patients are not the only ones who should be blinded: doctors and researchers can accidentally bias a study. When a doctor knows a patient has been given the real treatment, she might inadvertently give that patient more attention or care than a patient that she knows is on the placebo. To guard against this bias, which again has been found to have a measurable effect in some instances, most modern studies employ a \term{double-blind} setup where doctors or researchers who interact with patients are, just like the patients, unaware of who is or is not receiving the treatment.\footnote{There are always some researchers involved in the study who do know which patients are receiving which treatment. However, they do not interact with the study's patients and do not tell the blinded health care professionals who is receiving which treatment.}

\begin{exercise}
Look back to the study in Section~\ref{basicExampleOfStentsAndStrokes} where researchers were testing whether stents were effective at reducing strokes in at-risk patients. Is this an experiment? Was the study blinded? Was it double-blinded?\footnote{The researchers assigned the patients into their treatment groups, so this study was an experiment. However, the patients could distinguish what treatment they received, so this study was not blind. The study could not be double-blind since it was not blind.}
\end{exercise}

\section[Examining numerical data]{Examining numerical data \sectionvideohref{youtube-Xm0PPtci3JE&list=PLkIselvEzpM6pZ76FD3NoCvvgkj_p-dE8}}
\label{numericalData}

In this section we will be introduced to techniques for exploring and summarizing numerical variables. The \data{email50} and \data{county} data sets from Section~\ref{dataBasics} provide rich opportunities for examples. Recall that outcomes of numerical variables are numbers on which it is reasonable to perform basic arithmetic operations. For example, the \var{pop2010} variable, which represents the populations of counties in 2010, is numerical since we can sensibly discuss the difference or ratio of the populations in two counties. On the other hand, area codes and zip codes are not numerical, but rather they are~categorical variables.


\subsection{Scatterplots for paired data}
\label{scatterPlots}

\index{data!email50|(}

A \term{scatterplot} provides a case-by-case view of data for two numerical variables. In Figure~\vref{county_fed_spendVsPoverty}, a scatterplot was used to examine how federal spending and poverty were related in the \data{county} data set. Another scatterplot is shown in Figure~\ref{email50LinesCharacters}, comparing the number of line breaks (\var{line\_\hspace{0.3mm}breaks}) and number of characters (\var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char}) in emails for the \data{email50} data set. In any scatterplot, each point represents a single case. Since there are 50 cases in \data{email50}, there are 50 points in Figure~\ref{email50LinesCharacters}.

\end{figure}

\textC{\setlength{\captionwidth}{\mycaptionwidth}}

To put the number of characters in perspective, this paragraph has 363 characters. Looking at Figure~\ref{email50LinesCharacters}, it seems that some emails are incredibly verbose! Upon further investigation, we would actually find that most of the long emails use the HTML format, which means most of the characters in those emails are used to format the email rather than provide text.

\begin{exercise}
What do scatterplots reveal about the data, and how might they be useful?\footnote{Answers may vary. Scatterplots are helpful in quickly spotting associations relating variables, whether those associations come in the form of simple trends or whether those relationships are more complex.}
\end{exercise}

\index{data!cars|(}
\begin{example}{Consider a new data set of 54 cars with two variables: vehicle price and~weight.\footnote{Subset of data from \oiRedirect{textbook-1993_car_data}{www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v1n1/datasets.lock.html}} A scatterplot of vehicle price versus weight is shown in Figure~\ref{carsPriceVsWeight}. What can be said about the relationship between these variables?}
The relationship is evidently nonlinear, as highlighted by the dashed line. This is different from previous scatterplots we've seen, such as Figure~\vref{county_fed_spendVsPoverty} and Figure~\ref{email50LinesCharacters}, which show relationships that are very linear.

\begin{exercise}
Describe two variables that would have a horseshoe shaped association in a scatterplot.\footnote{Consider the case where your vertical axis represents something ``good'' and your horizontal axis represents something that is only good in moderation. Health and water consumption fit this description since water becomes toxic when consumed in excessive quantities.}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Dot plots and the mean}
\label{dotPlot}

Sometimes two variables are one too many: only one variable may be of interest. In these cases, a dot plot provides the most basic of displays. A~\term{dot plot} is a one-variable scatterplot; an example using the number of characters from 50 emails is shown in Figure~\ref{emailCharactersDotPlot}. A stacked version of this dot plot is shown in Figure~\ref{emailCharactersDotPlotStacked}.

\begin{figure}[h]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/emailCharactersDotPlot/emailCharactersDotPlot}
   \caption{A dot plot of \var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char} for the \data{email50} data set.}
   \label{emailCharactersDotPlot}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.72\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/emailCharactersDotPlot/emailCharactersDotPlotStacked}
   \caption{A stacked dot plot of \var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char} for the \data{email50} data set. The~values have been rounded to the nearest 2,000 in this plot.}
   \label{emailCharactersDotPlotStacked}
\end{figure}

The \term{mean}, sometimes called the \indexthis{average}{mean!average}, is a common way to measure the center of a \term{distribution} of data. To find the mean number of characters in the 50 emails, we add up all the character counts and divide by the number of emails. For computational convenience, the number of characters is listed in the thousands and rounded to the first~decimal.
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{x} = \frac{21.7 + 7.0 + \cdots + 15.8}{50} = 11.6
\label{sampleMeanEquation}
\end{eqnarray}
The sample mean is often labeled $\bar{x}$\marginpar[\raggedright$\bar{x}$\\\footnotesize sample\\ mean]{\raggedright$\bar{x}$\\\footnotesize sample\\ mean}. The letter $x$ is being used as a generic placeholder for the variable of interest, \var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char}, and the bar over on the $x$ communicates that the average number of characters in the 50 emails was 11,600. It is useful to think of the mean as the balancing point of the distribution. The sample mean is shown as a triangle in Figures~\ref{emailCharactersDotPlot} and~\ref{emailCharactersDotPlotStacked}.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Mean}%
The sample mean of a numerical variable is computed as the sum of all of the observations divided by the number of observations:
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{x} = \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}{n}
\label{meanEquation}
\end{eqnarray}
where $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ represent the $n$ observed values.}
\end{termBox}\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-8mm}

$n$\\\footnotesize sample size}\vspace{-2mm}

\begin{exercise}
Examine Equations~\eqref{sampleMeanEquation} and~\eqref{meanEquation} above. What does $x_1$ correspond to? And $x_2$? Can you infer a general meaning to what $x_i$ might represent?\footnote{$x_1$ corresponds to the number of characters in the first email in the sample (21.7, in thousands), $x_2$ to the number of characters in the second email (7.0, in thousands), and $x_i$ corresponds to the number of characters in the $i^{th}$ email in the data set.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What was $n$ in this sample of emails?\footnote{The sample size was $n=50$.}
\end{exercise}

The \data{email50} data set represents a sample from a larger population of emails that were received in January and March. We could compute a mean for this population in the same way as the sample mean, however, the population mean has a special label: $\mu$\marginpar[\raggedright$\mu$\\\footnotesize population\\ mean]{\raggedright$\mu$\\\footnotesize population\\ mean}. \index{Greek!mu@mu ($\mu$)} The symbol $\mu$ is the Greek letter \emph{mu} and represents the average of all observations in the population. Sometimes a subscript, such as $_x$, is used to represent which variable the population mean refers to, e.g. $\mu_x$.

\begin{example}{The average number of characters across all emails can be estimated using the sample data. Based on the sample of 50 emails, what would be a reasonable estimate of $\mu_x$, the mean number of characters in all emails in the \data{email} data set? (Recall that \data{email50} is a sample from \data{email}.)}
The sample mean, 11,600, may provide a reasonable estimate of $\mu_x$. While this number will not be perfect, it provides a \emph{point estimate} of the population mean. In Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference} and beyond, we will develop tools to characterize the accuracy of point estimates, and we will find that point estimates based on larger samples tend to be more accurate than those based on smaller samples.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{We might like to compute the average income per person in the US. To do so, we might first think to take the mean of the per capita incomes across the 3,143 counties in the \data{county} data set. What would be a better approach?} \label{wtdMeanOfIncome}
The \data{county} data set is special in that each county actually represents many individual people. If we were to simply average across the \var{income} variable, we would be treating counties with 5,000 and 5,000,000 residents equally in the calculations. Instead, we should compute the total income for each county, add up all the counties' totals, and then divide by the number of people in all the counties. If we completed these steps with the \data{county} data, we would find that the per capita income for the US is \$27,348.43. Had we computed the \emph{simple} mean of per capita income across counties, the result would have been just \$22,504.70!
\end{example}

Example~\ref{wtdMeanOfIncome} used what is called a \term{weighted mean}\index{mean!weighted mean}, which will not be a key topic in this textbook. However, we have provided an online supplement on weighted means for interested readers:

\end{center}

\subsection{Histograms and shape}
\label{histogramsAndShape}

Dot plots show the exact value for each observation. This is useful for small data sets, but they can become hard to read with larger samples. Rather than showing the value of each observation, we prefer to think of the value as belonging to a \emph{bin}. For example, in the \data{email50} data set, we create a table of counts for the number of cases with character counts between 0 and 5,000, then the number of cases between 5,000 and 10,000, and so on. Observations that fall on the boundary of a bin (e.g. 5,000) are allocated to the lower bin. This tabulation is shown in Table~\ref{binnedNumCharTable}. These binned counts are plotted as bars in Figure~\ref{email50NumCharHist} into what is called a \term{histogram}, which resembles the stacked dot plot shown in Figure~\ref{emailCharactersDotPlotStacked}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering\small
\begin{tabular}{l ccc ccc ccc c}
  \hline
Characters & \\
(in thousands) & \raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{0-5} & \raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{5-10} & \raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{10-15} & \raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{15-20} & \raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{20-25} & \raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{25-30} & \raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{$\cdots$} & \raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{55-60} & \raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{60-65} \\
  \hline

  \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{The counts for the binned \var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char} data.}
\label{binnedNumCharTable}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[bth]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.82\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/email50NumCharHist/email50NumCharHist}
   \caption{A histogram of \var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char}. This distribution is very strongly skewed to the right.\index{skew!example: very strong}}
   \label{email50NumCharHist}
\end{figure}

Histograms provide a view of the \term{data density}. Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more common. For instance, there are many more emails with fewer than 20,000 characters than emails with at least 20,000 in the data set. The bars make it easy to see how the density of the data changes relative to the number of characters.

Histograms are especially convenient for describing the shape of the data distribution\label{shapeFirstDiscussed}. Figure~\ref{email50NumCharHist} shows that most emails have a relatively small number of characters, while fewer emails have a very large number of characters. When data trail off to the right in this way and have a longer right \hiddenterm{tail}\index{skew!tail}, the shape is said to be \termsub{right skewed}{skew!right skewed}.\footnote{Other ways to describe data that are skewed to the right: \termni{skewed to the right}, \termni{skewed to the high end}, or \termni{skewed to the positive end}.}

Data sets with the reverse characteristic -- a long, thin tail to the left -- are said to be \termsub{left skewed}{skew!left skewed}. We also say that such a distribution has a long left tail. Data sets that show roughly equal trailing off in both directions are called \term{symmetric}.\index{skew!symmetric}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Long tails to identify skew}%
When data trail off in one direction, the distribution has a \term{long tail}. \index{skew!long tail|textbf} If a distribution has a long left tail, it is left skewed. If a distribution has a long right tail, it is right skewed.}
\end{termBox}

\begin{exercise}
Take a look at the dot plots in Figures~\ref{emailCharactersDotPlot} and~\ref{emailCharactersDotPlotStacked}. Can you see the skew in the data? Is it easier to see the skew in this histogram or the dot plots?\footnote{The skew is visible in all three plots, though the flat dot plot is the least useful. The stacked dot plot and histogram are helpful visualizations for identifying skew.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Besides the mean (since it was labeled), what can you see in the dot plots that you cannot see in the histogram?\footnote{Character counts for individual emails.}
\end{exercise}

In addition to looking at whether a distribution is skewed or symmetric, histograms can be used to identify modes. A \term{mode} is represented by a prominent peak in the distribution.\footnote{Another definition of mode, which is not typically used in statistics, is the value with the most occurrences. It is common to have \emph{no} observations with the same value in a data set, which makes this other definition useless for many real data sets.} There is only one prominent peak in the histogram of \var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char}.

Figure~\ref{singleBiMultiModalPlots} shows histograms that have one, two, or three prominent peaks. Such distributions are called \termsub{unimodal}{modality!unimodal}, \termsub{bimodal}{modality!bimodal}, and \termsub{multimodal}{modality!multimodal}, respectively. Any distribution with more than 2 prominent peaks is called multimodal. Notice that there was one prominent peak in the unimodal distribution with a second less prominent peak that was not counted since it only differs from its neighboring bins by a few observations.

\begin{figure}[h]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/singleBiMultiModalPlots/singleBiMultiModalPlots}
   \caption{Counting only prominent peaks, the distributions are (left to right) unimodal, bimodal, and multimodal.}
   \label{singleBiMultiModalPlots}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
Figure~\ref{email50NumCharHist} reveals only one prominent mode in the number of characters. Is the distribution unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal?\footnote{Unimodal. Remember that \emph{uni} stands for 1 (think \emph{uni}cycles). Similarly, \emph{bi} stands for~2 (think \emph{bi}cycles). (We're hoping a \emph{multicycle} will be invented to complete this analogy.)}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Height measurements of young students and adult teachers at a K-3 elementary school were taken. How many modes would you anticipate in this height data set?\footnote{There might be two height groups visible in the data set: one of the students and one of the adults. That is, the data are probably bimodal.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Looking for modes}
Looking for modes isn't about finding a clear and correct answer about the number of modes in a distribution, which is why \emph{prominent} is not rigorously defined in this book. The important part of this examination is to better understand your data and how it might be structured.}
\end{tipBox}


\subsection{Variance and standard deviation}
\label{variability}

The mean was introduced as a method to describe the center of a data set, but the \indexthis{variability}{variability} in the data is also important. Here, we introduce two measures of variability: the variance and the standard deviation. Both of these are very useful in data analysis, even though their formulas are a bit tedious to calculate by hand. The standard deviation is the easier of the two to understand, and it roughly describes how far away the typical observation is from the mean.

We call the distance of an observation from its mean its \term{deviation}. Below are the deviations for the $1^{st}_{}$, $2^{nd}_{}$, $3^{rd}$, and $50^{th}_{}$ observations in the \var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char} variable. For computational convenience, the number of characters is listed in the thousands and rounded to the first decimal.
\begin{align*}
x_1^{}-\bar{x} &= 21.7 - 11.6 = 10.1 \hspace{5mm}\text{ } \\
x_2^{}-\bar{x} &= 7.0 - 11.6 = -4.6 \\
x_3^{}-\bar{x} &= 0.6 - 11.6 = -11.0 \\
			&\ \vdots \\
x_{50}^{}-\bar{x} &= 15.8 - 11.6 = 4.2
\end{align*}
% library(openintro); d <- email50$num_char; round(mean(d),1); d[c(1,2,3,50)]; d[c(1,2,3,50)] - round(mean(d),1); (d[c(1,2,3,50)] - round(mean(d)))^2; sum((d - round(mean(d)))^2)/49; sqrt(sum((d - round(mean(d)))^2)/49); var(d); sd(d)
If we square these deviations and then take an average, the result is about equal to the sample \term{variance}\label{varianceIsDefined}, denoted by $s_{}^2$\marginpar[\raggedright$s^2_{}$\\\footnotesize sample variance]{\raggedright$s^2_{}$\\\footnotesize sample variance}:
\begin{align*}
s_{}^2 &= \frac{10.1_{}^2 + (-4.6)_{}^2 + (-11.0)_{}^2 + \cdots + 4.2_{}^2}{50-1} \\
	&= \frac{102.01 + 21.16 + 121.00 + \cdots + 17.64}{49} \\
	&= 172.44
\end{align*}
We divide by $n-1$, rather than dividing by $n$, when computing the variance; you need not worry about this mathematical nuance for the material in this textbook. Notice that squaring the deviations does two things. First, it makes large values much larger, seen by comparing $10.1^2$, $(-4.6)^2$, $(-11.0)^2$, and $4.2^2$. Second, it gets rid of any negative signs.

The \term{standard deviation} is defined as the square root of the variance:
$$s=\sqrt{172.44} = 13.13$$
\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-10mm}

$s$\\\footnotesize sample standard deviation]{\raggedright\vspace{-10mm}

$s$\\\footnotesize sample standard deviation
}\index{s@$s$}The standard deviation of the number of characters in an email is about 13.13 thousand. A subscript of $_x$ may be added to the variance and standard deviation, i.e. $s_x^2$ and $s_x^{}$, as a reminder that these are the variance and standard deviation of the observations represented by $x_1^{}$, $x_2^{}$, ..., $x_n^{}$. The $_{x}$ subscript is usually omitted when it is clear which data the variance or standard deviation is referencing.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Variance and standard deviation}
The variance is roughly the average squared distance from the mean. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The standard deviation is useful when considering how close the data are to the mean.}
\end{termBox}

Formulas and methods used to compute the variance and standard deviation for a population are similar to those used for a sample.\footnote{The only difference is that the population variance has a division by $n$ instead of $n-1$.} However, like the mean, the population values have special symbols: $\sigma_{}^2$\marginpar[\raggedright$\sigma_{}^2$\\\footnotesize population variance\\ \hspace{2mm}]{\raggedright$\sigma_{}^2$\\\footnotesize population variance\\ \hspace{2mm}} for the variance and $\sigma$\marginpar[\raggedright$\sigma$\\\footnotesize population standard deviation\\ \hspace{2mm}]{\raggedright$\sigma$\\\footnotesize population standard deviation\\ \hspace{2mm}} for the standard deviation. The symbol $\sigma$ \index{Greek!sigma@sigma ($\sigma$)} is the Greek letter \emph{sigma}.

\caption{In the \var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char} data, 41 of the 50 emails (82\%) are within 1~standard deviation of the mean, and 47 of the 50 emails (94\%) are within 2 standard deviations. Usually about 70\% of the data are within 1 standard deviation of the mean and 95\% are within 2 standard deviations, though this rule of thumb is less accurate for skewed data, as shown in this example.}
\label{sdAsRuleForEmailNumChar}
\end{figure}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{standard deviation describes variability}
Focus on the conceptual meaning of the standard deviation as a descriptor of variability rather than the formulas. Usually 70\% of the data will be within one standard deviation of the mean and about 95\% will be within two standard deviations. However, as seen in Figures~\ref{sdAsRuleForEmailNumChar} and~\ref{severalDiffDistWithSdOf1}, these percentages are not strict rules.}
\end{tipBox}

\label{severalDiffDistWithSdOf1}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
On page~\pageref{shapeFirstDiscussed}, the concept of shape of a distribution was introduced. A good description of the shape of a distribution should include modality and whether the distribution is symmetric or skewed to one side. Using Figure~\ref{severalDiffDistWithSdOf1} as an example, explain why such a description is important.\footnote{Figure~\ref{severalDiffDistWithSdOf1} shows three distributions that look quite different, but all have the same mean, variance, and standard deviation. Using modality, we can distinguish between the first plot (bimodal) and the last two (unimodal). Using skewness, we can distinguish between the last plot (right skewed) and the first two. While a picture, like a histogram, tells a more complete story, we can use modality and shape (symmetry/skew) to characterize basic information about a~distribution.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{Describe the distribution of the \var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char} variable using the histogram in Figure~\vref{email50NumCharHist}. The description should incorporate the center, variability, and shape of the distribution, and it should also be placed in context: the number of characters in emails. Also note any especially unusual cases.}
The distribution of email character counts is unimodal and very strongly skewed to the high end. Many of the counts fall near the mean at 11,600, and most fall within one standard deviation (13,130) of the mean. There is one exceptionally long email with about 65,000 characters.
\end{example}

In practice, the variance and standard deviation are sometimes used as a means to an end, where the ``end'' is being able to accurately estimate the uncertainty associated with a sample statistic. For example, in Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference} we will use the variance and standard deviation to assess how close the sample mean is to the population mean.

\subsection{Box plots, quartiles, and the median}

A \term{box plot} summarizes a data set using five statistics while also plotting unusual observations. Figure~\ref{boxPlotLayoutNumVar} provides a vertical dot plot alongside a box plot of the \var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char} variable from the \data{email50} data set.

\begin{figure}[h]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.86\mycaptionwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/boxPlotLayoutNumVar/boxPlotLayoutNumVar}
   \caption{A vertical dot plot next to a labeled box plot for the number of characters in 50 emails. The median (6,890), splits the data into the bottom 50\% and the top 50\%, marked in the dot plot by horizontal dashes and open circles, respectively.}
   \label{boxPlotLayoutNumVar}
\end{figure}

The first step in building a box plot is drawing a dark line denoting the \term{median}, which splits the data in half. Figure~\ref{boxPlotLayoutNumVar} shows 50\% of the data falling below the median (dashes) and other 50\% falling above the median (open circles). There are 50 character counts in the data set (an even number) so the data are perfectly split into two groups of~25. We take the median in this case to be the average of the two observations closest to the $50^{th}$ percentile: $(\text{6,768} + \text{7,012}) / 2 = \text{6,890}$. When there are an odd number of observations, there will be exactly one observation that splits the data into two halves, and in this case that observation is the median (no average needed).

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Median: the number in the middle}
If the data are ordered from smallest to largest, the \term{median} is the observation right in the middle. If there are an even number of observations, there will be two values in the middle, and the median is taken as their average.}
\end{termBox}

The second step in building a box plot is drawing a rectangle to represent the middle 50\% of the data. The total length of the box, shown vertically in Figure~\ref{boxPlotLayoutNumVar}, is called the \term{interquartile range} (\hiddenterm{IQR}, for short). It, like the standard deviation, is a measure of \indexthis{variability}{variability} in data. The more variable the data, the larger the standard deviation and~IQR. The two boundaries of the box are called the \term{first quartile} \index{quartile!first quartile} (the $25^{th}$ \hiddenterm{percentile}, i.e. 25\% of the data fall below this value) and the \term{third quartile} \index{quartile!third quartile} (the $75^{th}$ percentile), and these are often labeled $Q_1$ \index{Q$_1$} and $Q_3$\index{Q$_3$}, respectively.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Interquartile range (IQR)}
The IQR\index{interquartile range} is the length of the box in a box plot. It is computed as
\begin{eqnarray*}
IQR = Q_3 - Q_1
\end{eqnarray*}
where $Q_1$ and $Q_3$ are the $25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentiles.}
\end{termBox}

\begin{exercise}
What percent of the data fall between $Q_1$ and the median? What percent is between the median and $Q_3$?\footnote{Since $Q_1$ and $Q_3$ capture the middle 50\% of the data and the median splits the data in the middle, 25\% of the data fall between $Q_1$ and the median, and another 25\% falls between the median and $Q_3$.}
\end{exercise}

Extending out from the box, the \term{whiskers} attempt to capture the data outside of the box, however, their reach is never allowed to be more than $1.5\times IQR$.\footnote{While the choice of exactly 1.5 is arbitrary, it is the most commonly used value for box plots.} They capture everything within this reach. In Figure~\ref{boxPlotLayoutNumVar}, the upper whisker does not extend to the last three points, which is beyond $Q_3 + 1.5\times IQR$, and so it extends only to the last point below this limit. The lower whisker stops at the lowest value, 33, since there is no additional data to reach; the lower whisker's limit is not shown in the figure because the plot does not extend down to $Q_1 - 1.5\times IQR$. In a sense, the box is like the body of the box plot and the whiskers are like its arms trying to reach the rest of the data.

Any observation that lies beyond the whiskers is labeled with a dot. The purpose of labeling these points -- instead of just extending the whiskers to the minimum and maximum observed values -- is to help identify any observations that appear to be unusually distant from the rest of the data. Unusually distant observations are called \termsub{outliers}{outlier}. In this case, it would be reasonable to classify the emails with character counts of 41,623, 42,793, and 64,401 as outliers since they are numerically distant from most of the data.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Outliers are extreme}
An \term{outlier} is an observation that appears extreme relative to the rest of the data.}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Why it is important to look for outliers}

\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Identifying \indexthis{strong skew}{skew!example: strong} in the distribution.

Using Figure~\ref{boxPlotLayoutNumVar}, estimate the following values for \var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char} in the \data{email50} data set: (a) $Q_1$, (b) $Q_3$, and (c) IQR.\footnote{These visual estimates will vary a little from one person to the next: $Q_1=$ 3,000, $Q_3=$ 15,000, $\text{IQR}=Q_3 - Q_1 = $ 12,000.

\subsection{Robust statistics}

How are the \indexthis{sample statistics}{sample statistic} of the \data{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char} data set affected by the observation, 64,401? What would have happened if this email wasn't observed? What would happen to these \indexthis{summary statistics}{summary statistic} if the observation at 64,401 had been even larger, say 150,000? These scenarios are plotted alongside the original data in Figure~\ref{email50NumCharDotPlotRobustEx}, and sample statistics are computed under each scenario in Table~\ref{robustOrNotTable}.

\begin{exercise} \label{numCharWhichIsMoreRobust}
(a) Which is more affected by extreme observations, the mean or median? Table~\ref{robustOrNotTable} may be helpful. (b) Is the standard deviation or IQR more affected by extreme observations?\footnote{(a) Mean is affected more. (b) Standard deviation is affected more. Complete explanations are provided in the material following Guided Practice~\ref{numCharWhichIsMoreRobust}.}
\end{exercise}

The median and IQR are called \term{robust estimates} because extreme observations have little effect on their values. The mean and standard deviation are much more affected by changes in extreme observations.

\begin{example}{The median and IQR do not change much under the three scenarios in Table~\ref{robustOrNotTable}. Why might this be the case?}
The median and IQR are only sensitive to numbers near $Q_1$, the median, and $Q_3$. Since values in these regions are relatively stable -- there aren't large jumps between observations -- the median and IQR estimates are also quite stable.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
The distribution of vehicle prices tends to be right skewed, with a few luxury and sports cars lingering out into the right tail. If you were searching for a new car and cared about price, should you be more interested in the mean or median price of vehicles sold, assuming you are in the market for a regular car?\footnote{Buyers of a ``regular car'' should be concerned about the median price. High-end car sales can drastically inflate the mean price while the median will be more robust to the influence of those sales.}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Transforming data (special topic)}
\label{transformingDataSubsection}

When data are very strongly skewed, we sometimes transform them so they are easier to model. Consider the histogram of salaries for Major League Baseball players' salaries from 2010, which is shown in Figure~\ref{histMLBSalariesReg}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\subfigure[]{
\includegraphics[width=0.46\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/histMLBSalaries/histMLBSalariesReg}
\label{histMLBSalariesReg}

}
\caption{\subref{histMLBSalariesReg} Histogram of MLB player salaries for 2010, in millions of dollars. \subref{histMLBSalariesLog} Histogram of the log-transformed MLB player salaries for 2010.}
\label{histMLBSalaries}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}{The histogram of MLB player salaries is useful in that we can see the data are extremely skewed\index{skew!example: extreme} and centered (as gauged by the median) at about \$1 million. What isn't useful about this plot?}
Most of the data are collected into one bin in the histogram and the data are so strongly skewed that many details in the data are obscured.
\end{example}

There are some standard transformations that are often applied when much of the data cluster near zero (relative to the larger values in the data set) and all observations are positive. A \term{transformation} is a rescaling of the data using a function. For instance, a plot of the natural logarithm\footnote{Statisticians often write the natural logarithm as $\log$. You might be more familiar with it being written as $\ln$.} of player salaries results in a new histogram in Figure~\ref{histMLBSalariesLog}. Transformed data are sometimes easier to work with when applying statistical models because the transformed data are much less skewed and outliers are usually less extreme.

Transformations can also be applied to one or both variables in a scatterplot. A scatterplot of the \var{line\_\hspace{0.3mm}breaks} and \var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char} variables is shown in Figure~\ref{email50LinesCharactersMod}, which was earlier shown in Figure~\ref{email50LinesCharacters}. We can see a positive association between the variables and that many observations are clustered near zero. In Chapter~\ref{linRegrForTwoVar}, we might want to use a straight line to model the data. However, we'll find that the data in their current state cannot be modeled very well. Figure~\ref{email50LinesCharactersModLog} shows a scatterplot where both the \var{line\_\hspace{0.3mm}breaks} and \var{num\_\hspace{0.3mm}char} variables have been transformed using a log (base $e$) transformation. While there is a positive association in each plot, the transformed data show a steadier trend, which is easier to model than the untransformed data.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\subfigure[]{
\includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/email50LinesCharactersMod/email50LinesCharactersMod}

\label{email50LinesCharactersModMain}
\end{figure}

Transformations other than the logarithm can be useful, too. For instance, the square root ($\sqrt{\text{original observation}}$) and inverse ($\frac{1}{\text{original observation}}$) are used by statisticians. Common goals in transforming data are to see the data structure differently, reduce skew, assist in modeling, or straighten a nonlinear relationship in a scatterplot.

\subsection{Mapping data (special topic)}

\index{data!county|(}
\index{intensity map|(}

The \data{county} data set offers many numerical variables that we could plot using dot plots, scatterplots, or box plots, but these miss the true nature of the data. Rather, when we encounter geographic data, we should map it using an \term{intensity map}, where colors are used to show higher and lower values of a variable. Figures~\ref{countyIntensityMaps1} and~\ref{countyIntensityMaps2} shows intensity maps for federal spending per capita (\var{fed\_\hspace{0.3mm}spend}), poverty rate in percent (\var{poverty}), homeownership rate in percent (\var{homeownership}), and median household income (\var{med\_\hspace{0.3mm}income}). The color key indicates which colors correspond to which values. Note that the intensity maps are not generally very helpful for getting precise values in any given county, but they are very helpful for seeing geographic trends and generating interesting research questions.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/countyIntensityMaps/countyFedSpendMap}\label{countyFedSpendMap}}

\end{figure}

\textC{\pagebreak}

\begin{example}{What interesting features are evident in the \var{fed\_\hspace{0.3mm}spend} and \var{poverty} intensity maps?}
The federal spending intensity map shows substantial spending in the Dakotas and along the central-to-western part of the Canadian border, which may be related to the oil boom in this region. There are several other patches of federal spending, such as a vertical strip in eastern Utah and Arizona and the area where Colorado, Nebraska, and Kansas meet. There are also seemingly random counties with very high federal spending relative to their neighbors. If we did not cap the federal spending range at \$18 per capita, we would actually find that some counties have extremely high federal spending while there is almost no federal spending in the neighboring counties. These high-spending counties might contain military bases, companies with large government contracts, or other government facilities with many employees.

Poverty rates are evidently higher in a few locations. Notably, the deep south shows higher poverty rates, as does the southwest border of Texas. The vertical strip of eastern Utah and Arizona, noted above for its higher federal spending, also appears to have higher rates of poverty (though generally little correspondence is seen between the two variables).  High poverty rates are evident in the Mississippi flood plains a little north of New Orleans and also in a large section of Kentucky and West Virginia.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
What interesting features are evident in the \var{med\_\hspace{0.3mm}income} intensity map in Figure~\ref{countyMedIncomeMap}?\footnote{Note: answers will vary. There is a very strong correspondence between high earning and metropolitan areas. You might look for large cities you are familiar with and try to spot them on the map as dark spots.}

\label{categoricalData}

\index{data!email|(}

Like numerical data, categorical data can also be organized and analyzed. In this section, we will introduce tables and other basic tools for categorical data that are used throughout this book. The \data{email50} data set represents a sample from a larger email data set called \data{email}. This larger data set contains information on 3,921 emails. In this section we will examine whether the presence of numbers, small or large, in an email provides any useful value in classifying email as spam or not spam.
% library(openintro); data(email); dim(email)

\subsection{Contingency tables and bar plots}

Table~\ref{emailSpamNumberTableTotals} summarizes two variables: \var{spam} and \var{number}. Recall that \var{number} is a categorical variable that describes whether an email contains no numbers, only small numbers (values under 1 million), or at least one big number (a value of 1 million or more). A table that summarizes data for two categorical variables in this way is called a \term{contingency table}. Each value in the table represents the number of times a particular combination of variable outcomes occurred. For example, the value 149 corresponds to the number of emails in the data set that are spam \emph{and} had no number listed in the email. Row and column totals are also included. The \term{row totals} \index{contingency table!row totals} provide the total counts across each row (e.g. $149 + 168 + 50 = 367$), and \term{column totals} \index{contingency table!column totals} are total counts down each column.

A table for a single variable is called a \term{frequency table}. Table~\ref{emailNumberTable} is a frequency table for the \var{number} variable. If we replaced the counts with percentages or proportions, the table would be called a \term{relative frequency table}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll  ccc  rr}

  \cline{3-5}

\label{emailSpamNumberTableTotals}
%library(openintro); library(xtable); data(email); tab <- table(email[,c("spam", "number")])[2:1,]; xtable(tab); rowSums(tab); colSums(tab); sum(tab)
\end{table}

\end{table}
%library(openintro); library(xtable); data(email); xtable(table(email[,c("html")]))

A bar plot is a common way to display a single categorical variable. The left panel of Figure~\ref{emailNumberBarPlot} shows a \term{bar plot} for the \var{number} variable. In the right panel, the counts are converted into proportions (e.g. $549/3921=0.140$ for \resp{none}), showing the proportion of observations that are in each level (i.e. in each category).

\begin{figure}[bht]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/emailNumberBarPlot/emailNumberBarPlot}
   \caption{Two bar plots of \var{number}. The left panel shows the counts, and the right panel shows the proportions in each group.}
   \label{emailNumberBarPlot}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Row and column proportions}

Table~\ref{rowPropSpamNumber} shows the row proportions for Table~\ref{emailSpamNumberTableTotals}. The \termsub{row proportions}{contingency table!row proportions} are computed as the counts divided by their row totals. The value 149 at the intersection of \resp{spam} and \resp{none} is replaced by $149/367=0.406$, i.e. 149 divided by its row total, 367. So what does 0.406 represent? It corresponds to the proportion of spam emails in the sample that do not have any numbers.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l rrr r}
  \hline
 & none & small & big & Total \\ 
  \hline
spam &  $149/367 = 0.406$ & $168/367 = 0.458$ &
			$50/367 = 0.136$ & 1.000 \\ 
not spam &  $400/3554 = 0.113$ & $2657/3554 = 0.748$ &
			$495/3554 = 0.139$ & 1.000 \\ 
   \hline
Total & $549/3921 = 0.140$ & $2827/3921 = 0.721$ &
			$545/3921 = 0.139$ & 1.000 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{A contingency table with row proportions for the \var{spam} and \var{number} variables.}
\label{rowPropSpamNumber}
% library(openintro); data(email); g <- table(email$spam, email$number)[2:1,]; g / rep(rowSums(g), 3); rowSums(g)
\end{table}

A contingency table of the column proportions is computed in a similar way, where each \termsub{column proportion}{contingency table!column proportion} is computed as the count divided by the corresponding column total. Table~\ref{colPropSpamNumber} shows such a table, and here the value 0.271 indicates that 27.1\% of emails with no numbers were spam. This rate of spam is much higher compared to emails with only small numbers (5.9\%) or big numbers (9.2\%). Because these spam rates vary between the three levels of \var{number} (\resp{none}, \resp{small}, \resp{big}), this provides evidence that the \var{spam} and \var{number} variables are associated.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering\small
\begin{tabular}{l rrr r}
  \hline
 & none & small & big & Total \\ 
  \hline
spam &  $149/549 = 0.271$ & $168/2827 = 0.059$ &
				$50/545 = 0.092$ & $367/3921 = 0.094$ \\ 
not spam &  $400/549 = 0.729$ & $2659/2827 = 0.941$ &
				$495/545 = 0.908$ & $3684/3921 = 0.906$ \\ 
   \hline
Total & 1.000 & 1.000 & 1.000 & 1.000 \\
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{A contingency table with column proportions for the \var{spam} and \var{number} variables.}
\label{colPropSpamNumber}
% library(openintro); data(email); g <- table(email$spam, email$number)[2:1,]; g / rep(colSums(g), rep(2, 3)); g; colSums(g)
\end{table}

We could also have checked for an association between \var{spam} and \var{number} in Table~\ref{rowPropSpamNumber} using row proportions. When comparing these row proportions, we would look down columns to see if the fraction of emails with no numbers, small numbers, and big numbers varied from \resp{spam} to \resp{not~spam}.

\begin{exercise}
What does 0.458 represent in Table~\ref{rowPropSpamNumber}? What does 0.059 represent in Table~\ref{colPropSpamNumber}?\footnote{0.458 represents the proportion of spam emails that had a small number. 0.059 represents the fraction of emails with small numbers that are spam.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What does 0.139 at the intersection of \resp{not~spam} and \resp{big} represent in Table~\ref{rowPropSpamNumber}? What does 0.908 represent in the Table~\ref{colPropSpamNumber}?\footnote{0.139 represents the fraction of non-spam email that had a big number. 0.908 represents the fraction of emails with big numbers that are non-spam emails.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{Data scientists use statistics to filter spam from incoming email messages. By noting specific characteristics of an email, a data scientist may be able to classify some emails as spam or not spam with high accuracy. One of those characteristics is whether the email contains no numbers, small numbers, or big numbers. Another characteristic is whether or not an email has any HTML content. A contingency table for the \var{spam} and \var{format} variables from the \data{email} data set are shown in Table~\ref{emailSpamHTMLTableTotals}. Recall that an HTML email is an email with the capacity for special formatting, e.g. bold text. In Table~\ref{emailSpamHTMLTableTotals}, which would be more helpful to someone hoping to classify email as spam or regular email: row or column proportions?} \label{weighingRowColumnProportions}
Such a person would be interested in how the proportion of spam changes within each email format. This corresponds to column proportions: the proportion of spam in plain text emails and the proportion of spam in HTML emails.

If we generate the column proportions, we can see that a higher fraction of plain text emails are spam ($209/1195 = 17.5\%$) than compared to HTML emails ($158/2726 = 5.8\%$). This information on its own is insufficient to classify an email as spam or not spam, as over 80\% of plain text emails are not spam. Yet, when we carefully combine this information with many other characteristics, such as \var{number} and other variables, we stand a reasonable chance of being able to classify some email as spam or not spam. \GLMSection{This is a topic we will return to in Chapter~\ref{multipleRegressionAndANOVA}.}{}
\end{example}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l cc r}
  \hline
 & text & HTML & Total \\ 
  \hline
spam & 209 & 158 & 367 \\ 
not spam & 986 & 2568 & 3554 \\ 
   \hline
Total & 1195 & 2726 & 3921 \\
   \hline
\end{tabular}

%library(openintro); library(xtable); data(email); tab <- table(email[,c("spam", "format")])[2:1,]; tab; colSums(tab); rowSums(tab)
\end{table}

Example~\ref{weighingRowColumnProportions} points out that row and column proportions are not equivalent. Before settling on one form for a table, it is important to consider each to ensure that the most useful table is constructed.

\begin{exercise}
Look back to Tables~\ref{rowPropSpamNumber} and~\ref{colPropSpamNumber}. Which would be more useful to someone hoping to identify spam emails using the \var{number} variable?\footnote{The column proportions in Table~\ref{colPropSpamNumber} will probably be most useful, which makes it easier to see that emails with small numbers are spam about 5.9\% of the time (relatively rare). We would also see that about 27.1\% of emails with no numbers are spam, and 9.2\% of emails with big numbers are spam.}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Segmented bar and mosaic plots}
\label{segmentedBarPlotsAndIndependence}

Contingency tables using row or column proportions are especially useful for examining how two categorical variables are related. Segmented bar and mosaic plots provide a way to visualize the information in these tables.

A \termsub{segmented bar plot}{bar plot!segmented bar plot} is a graphical display of contingency table information. For example, a segmented bar plot representing Table~\ref{colPropSpamNumber} is shown in Figure~\ref{emailSpamNumberSegBar}, where we have first created a bar plot using the \var{number} variable and then divided each group by the levels of \var{spam}. The column proportions of Table~\ref{colPropSpamNumber} have been translated into a standardized segmented bar plot in Figure~\ref{emailSpamNumberSegBarSta}, which is a helpful visualization of the fraction of spam emails in each level of \var{number}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\subfigure[]{
\includegraphics[width=0.46\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/emailSpamNumberSegBar/emailSpamNumberSegBar}
\label{emailSpamNumberSegBar}

\subfigure[]{
\includegraphics[width=0.46\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/emailSpamNumberSegBar/emailSpamNumberSegBarSta}
\label{emailSpamNumberSegBarSta}
}
\caption{\subref{emailSpamNumberSegBar} Segmented bar plot for numbers found in emails, where the counts have been further broken down by \var{spam}. \subref{emailSpamNumberSegBarSta} Standardized version of Figure~\subref{emailSpamNumberSegBar}.}
\label{emailSpamNumberSegBarPlot}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}{Examine both of the segmented bar plots. Which is more useful?}
Figure~\ref{emailSpamNumberSegBar} contains more information, but Figure~\ref{emailSpamNumberSegBarSta} presents the information more clearly. This second plot makes it clear that emails with no number have a relatively high rate of spam email -- about 27\%! On the other hand, less than 10\% of email with small or big numbers are spam.
\end{example}

Since the proportion of spam changes across the groups in Figure~\ref{emailSpamNumberSegBarSta}, we can conclude the variables are dependent, which is something we were also able to discern using table proportions. Because both the \resp{none} and \resp{big} groups have relatively few observations compared to the \resp{small} group, the association is more difficult to see in Figure~\ref{emailSpamNumberSegBar}.

In some other cases, a segmented bar plot that is not standardized will be more useful in communicating important information. Before settling on a particular segmented bar plot, create standardized and non-standardized forms and decide which is more effective at communicating features of the data.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\subfigure[]{
\includegraphics[width=0.3934\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/emailSpamNumberMosaicPlot/emailNumberMosaic}

}
\caption{The one-variable mosaic plot for \var{number} and the two-variable mosaic plot for both \var{number} and \var{spam}.}
\label{emailSpamNumberMosaicPlot}
\end{figure}

A \term{mosaic plot} is a graphical display of contingency table information that is similar to a bar plot for one variable or a segmented bar plot when using two variables. Figure~\ref{emailNumberMosaic} shows a mosaic plot for the \var{number} variable. Each column represents a level of \var{number}, and the column widths correspond to the proportion of emails for each number~type. For~instance, there are fewer emails with no numbers than emails with only small numbers, so the no number email column is slimmer. In general, mosaic plots use box \emph{areas} to represent the number of observations that box represents.

\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.44\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/emailSpamNumberMosaicPlot/emailSpamNumberMosaicRev}
   \caption{Mosaic plot where emails are grouped by the \var{number} variable after they've been divided into \resp{spam} and \resp{not spam}.}
   \label{emailSpamNumberMosaicRev}
\end{figure}

This one-variable mosaic plot is further divided into pieces in Figure~\ref{emailSpamNumberMosaic} using the \var{spam} variable. Each column is split proportionally according to the fraction of emails that were spam in each number category. For example, the second column, representing emails with only small numbers, was divided into emails that were spam (lower) and not spam (upper). 
As another example, the bottom of the third column represents spam emails that had big numbers, and the upper part of the third column represents regular emails that had big numbers. We can again use this plot to see that the \var{spam} and \var{number} variables are associated since some columns are divided in different vertical locations than others, which was the same technique used for checking an association in the standardized version of the segmented bar plot.

In a similar way, a mosaic plot representing row proportions of Table~\ref{emailSpamNumberTableTotals} could be constructed, as shown in Figure~\ref{emailSpamNumberMosaicRev}. However, because it is more insightful for this application to consider the fraction of spam in each category of the \var{number} variable, we prefer Figure~\ref{emailSpamNumberMosaic}.

While pie charts are well known, they are not typically as useful as other charts in a data analysis. A \term{pie chart} is shown in Figure~\vref{emailNumberPieChart} alongside a bar plot. It is generally more difficult to compare group sizes in a pie chart than in a bar plot, especially when categories have nearly identical counts or proportions. In the case of the \resp{none} and \resp{big} categories, the difference is so slight you may be unable to distinguish any difference in group sizes for either~plot!

\subsection{Comparing numerical data across groups}
\label{comparingAcrossGroups}

\index{data!county|(}

Some of the more interesting investigations can be considered by examining numerical data across groups. The methods required here aren't really new. All that is required is to make a numerical plot for each group. Here two convenient methods are introduced: side-by-side box plots and hollow histograms.

We will take a look again at the \data{county} data set and compare the median household income for counties that gained population from 2000 to 2010 versus counties that had no gain. While we might like to make a causal connection here, remember that these are observational data and so such an interpretation would be unjustified.

There were 2,041 counties where the population increased from 2000 to 2010, and there were 1,099 counties with no gain (all but one were a loss). A~random sample of 100 counties from the first group and 50 from the second group are shown in Table~\ref{countyIncomeSplitByPopGainTable} to give a better sense of some of the raw data.

\begin{table}

\caption{In this table, median household income (in \$1000s) from a random sample of 100 counties that gained population over 2000-2010 are shown on the left. Median incomes from a random sample of 50 counties that had no population gain are shown on the right.}
\label{countyIncomeSplitByPopGainTable}
\end{table}

The \term{side-by-side box plot} \index{box plot!side-by-side box plot} is a traditional tool for comparing across groups. An example is shown in the left panel of Figure~\ref{countyIncomeSplitByPopGain}, where there are two box plots, one for each group, placed into one plotting window and drawn on the same scale.

\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/countyIncomeSplitByPopGain/countyIncomeSplitByPopGain}
   \caption{Side-by-side box plot (left panel) and hollow histograms (right panel) for \var{med\_\hspace{0.3mm}income}, where the counties are split by whether there was a population gain or loss from 2000 to 2010. The income data were collected between 2006 and 2010.}
   \label{countyIncomeSplitByPopGain}
\end{figure}

Another useful plotting method uses \termsub{hollow histograms}{hollow histogram} to compare numerical data across groups. These are just the outlines of histograms of each group put on the same plot, as shown in the right panel of Figure~\ref{countyIncomeSplitByPopGain}.

\begin{exercise} \label{comparingPriceByTypeExercise}
Use the plots in Figure~\ref{countyIncomeSplitByPopGain} to compare the incomes for counties across the two groups. What do you notice about the approximate center of each group? What do you notice about the variability between groups? Is the shape relatively consistent between groups? How many \emph{prominent} modes are there for each group?\footnote{Answers may vary a little. The counties with population gains tend to have higher income (median of about \$45,000) versus counties without a gain (median of about \$40,000). The variability is also slightly larger for the population gain group. This is evident in the IQR, which is about 50\% bigger in the \emph{gain} group. Both distributions show slight to moderate right skew\index{skew!example: slight to moderate} and are unimodal. There is a secondary small bump at about \$60,000 for the \emph{no gain} group, visible in the hollow histogram plot, that seems out of place. (Looking into the data set, we would find that 8 of these 15 counties are in Alaska and Texas.) The box plots indicate there are many observations far above the median in each group, though we should anticipate that many observations will fall beyond the whiskers when using such a large data set.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What components of each plot in Figure~\ref{countyIncomeSplitByPopGain} do you find most useful?\footnote{Answers will vary. The side-by-side box plots are especially useful for comparing centers and spreads, while the hollow histograms are more useful for seeing distribution shape, skew, and groups of anomalies.}

\label{caseStudyGenderDiscrimination}

\index{data!discrimination|(}

\begin{example}{Suppose your professor splits the students in class into two groups: students on the left and students on the right. If $\hat{p}_{_L}$ and $\hat{p}_{_R}$ represent the proportion of students who own an Apple product on the left and right, respectively, would you be surprised if $\hat{p}_{_L}$ did not {exactly} equal $\hat{p}_{_R}$?}\label{classRightLeftSideApple}
While the proportions would probably be close to each other, it would be unusual for them to be exactly the same. We would probably observe a small difference due to {chance}.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
If we don't think the side of the room a person sits on in class is related to whether the person owns an Apple product, what assumption are we making about the relationship between these two variables?\footnote{We would be assuming that these two variables are independent.}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Variability within data}
\label{variabilityWithinData}

We consider a study investigating gender discrimination in the 1970s, which is set in the context of personnel decisions within a bank.\footnote{Rosen B and Jerdee T. 1974. Influence of sex role stereotypes on personnel decisions. Journal of Applied Psychology 59(1):9-14.} The research question we hope to answer is, ``Are females unfairly discriminated against in promotion decisions made by male managers?"

The participants in this study are 48 male bank supervisors attending a management institute at the University of North Carolina in 1972. They were asked to assume the role of the personnel director of a bank and were given a personnel file to judge whether the person should be promoted to a branch manager position. The files given to the participants were identical, except that half of them indicated the candidate was male and the other half indicated the candidate was female. These files were randomly assigned to the subjects.

\begin{exercise}
Is this an observational study or an experiment? What implications does the study type have on what can be inferred from the results?\footnote{The study is an experiment, as subjects were randomly assigned a male file or a female file. Since this is an experiment, the results can be used to evaluate a causal relationship between gender of a candidate and the promotion decision.}
\end{exercise}

For each supervisor we record the gender associated with the assigned file and the promotion decision. Using the results of the study summarized in Table~\ref{discriminationResults}, we would like to evaluate if females are unfairly discriminated against in promotion decisions. In this study, a smaller proportion of females are promoted than males (0.583 versus 0.875), but it is unclear whether the difference provides \emph{convincing evidence} that females are unfairly discriminated against.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l l cc rr}
& & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\var{decision}} \\
  \cline{3-4}
		&			& 	{promoted} 	& {not promoted} & Total & \hspace{3mm}  \\ 
  \cline{2-5}

  \raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{\var{gender}}		&	{female} 	& 14    		& 10     & 24	 \\ 
  \cline{2-5}
  		&	Total		& 35	& 13	&  48 \\
  \cline{2-5}
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary results for the gender discrimination study.}
\label{discriminationResults}
\end{table}

\begin{example}{Statisticians are sometimes called upon to evaluate the strength of evidence. When looking at the rates of promotion for males and females in this study, what comes to mind as we try to determine whether the data show convincing evidence of a real difference?} \label{discriminationResultsWhatIsConvincingEvidence}
The observed promotion rates (58.3\% for females versus 87.5\% for males) suggest there might be discrimination against women in promotion decisions. However, we cannot be sure if the observed difference represents discrimination or is just from random chance. Generally there is a little bit of fluctuation in sample data, and we wouldn't expect the sample proportions to be \emph{exactly} equal, even if the truth was that the promotion decisions were independent of gender.
\end{example}

Example~\ref{discriminationResultsWhatIsConvincingEvidence} is a reminder that the observed outcomes in the sample may not perfectly reflect the true relationships between variables in the underlying population. Table~\ref{discriminationResults} shows there were 7 fewer promotions in the female group than in the male group, a difference in promotion rates of 29.2\% $\left( \frac{21}{24} - \frac{14}{24} = 0.292 \right)$. This difference is large, but the sample size for the study is small, making it unclear if this observed difference represents discrimination or whether it is simply due to chance. We label these two competing claims, $H_0$ and $H_A$:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] \textbf{Independence model.} The variables \var{gender} and \var{decision} are independent. They have no relationship, and the observed difference between the proportion of males and females who were promoted, 29.2\%, was due to chance.
\item[$H_A$:] \textbf{Alternative model.} The variables \var{gender} and \var{decision} are \emph{not} independent. The difference in promotion rates of 29.2\% was not due to chance, and equally qualified females are less likely to be promoted than males.
\end{itemize}

What would it mean if the independence model, which says the variables \var{gender} and \var{decision} are unrelated, is true? It would mean each banker was going to decide whether to promote the candidate without regard to the gender indicated on the file. That~is, the difference in the promotion percentages was due to the way the files were randomly divided to the bankers, and the randomization just happened to give rise to a relatively large difference of 29.2\%.

Consider the alternative model: bankers were influenced by which gender was listed on the personnel file. If this was true, and especially if this influence was substantial, we would expect to see some difference in the promotion rates of male and female candidates. If this gender bias was against females, we would expect a smaller fraction of promotion decisions for female personnel files relative to the male files.

We choose between these two competing claims by assessing if the data conflict so much with $H_0$ that the independence model cannot be deemed reasonable. If this is the case, and the data support $H_A$, then we will reject the notion of independence and conclude there was discrimination.

\subsection{Simulating the study}
\label{simulatingTheStudy}

Table~\ref{discriminationResults} shows that 35 bank supervisors recommended promotion and 13 did not. Now, suppose the bankers' decisions were independent of gender. Then, if we conducted the experiment again with a different random arrangement of files, differences in promotion rates would be based only on random fluctuation. We can actually perform this \term{randomization}, which simulates what would have happened if the bankers' decisions had been independent of gender but we had distributed the files differently.

In this \term{simulation}, we thoroughly shuffle 48 personnel files, 24 labeled \resp{male\_\hspace{0.3mm}sim} and 24 labeled \resp{female\_\hspace{0.3mm}sim}, and deal these files into two stacks. We will deal 35 files into the first stack, which will represent the 35 supervisors who recommended promotion. The second stack will have 13 files, and it will represent the 13 supervisors who recommended against promotion. Then, as we did with the original data, we tabulate the results and determine the fraction of \resp{male\_\hspace{0.3mm}sim} and \resp{female\_\hspace{0.3mm}sim} who were promoted. The randomization of files in this simulation is independent of the promotion decisions, which means any difference in the two fractions is entirely due to chance. Table~\ref{discriminationRand1} show the results of such a simulation.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l l cc rr}
& & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\var{decision}} \\
  \cline{3-4}
		&			& 	{promoted} 	& {not promoted} & Total & \hspace{3mm}  \\ 
  \cline{2-5}
		&	\resp{male\_\hspace{0.3mm}sim} 					& 18    		& 6    & 24 	 \\ 
  \raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{\var{gender\_\hspace{0.3mm}sim}}		&	\resp{female\_\hspace{0.3mm}sim} 	& 17    		& 7 & 24    	 \\ 
  \cline{2-5}
  & Total	& 35 & 13 & 48
\end{tabular}
\caption{Simulation results, where any difference in promotion rates between \resp{male\_\hspace{0.3mm}sim} and \resp{female\_\hspace{0.3mm}sim} is purely due to chance.}
\label{discriminationRand1}
\end{table}

\begin{exercise} \label{sampleDifferenceInMaleAndFemaleDiscrimination}
What is the difference in promotion rates between the two simulated groups in Table~\ref{discriminationRand1}? How does this compare to the observed 29.2\% in the actual groups?\footnote{$18/24 - 17/24=0.042$ or about 4.2\% in favor of the men. This difference due to chance is much smaller than the difference observed in the actual groups.}
\end{exercise}


\textC{\pagebreak}

\subsection{Checking for independence}

We computed one possible difference under the independence model in Guided Practice~\ref{sampleDifferenceInMaleAndFemaleDiscrimination}, which represents one difference due to chance. While in this first simulation, we physically dealt out files, it is more efficient to perform this simulation using a computer. Repeating the simulation on a computer, we get another difference due to chance: -0.042. And another: 0.208. And so on until we repeat the simulation enough times that we have a good idea of what represents the \emph{distribution of differences from chance alone}. Figure~\ref{discRandDotPlot} shows a plot of the differences found from 100 simulations, where each dot represents a simulated difference between the proportions of male and female files that were recommended for promotion.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{ch_intro_to_data/figures/discRandDotPlot/discRandDotPlot}
\caption{A stacked dot plot of differences from 100 simulations produced under the independence model, $H_0$, where \var{gender\_\hspace{0.3mm}sim} and \var{decision} are independent. Two of the 100 simulations had a difference of at least 29.2\%, the difference observed in the study.}
\label{discRandDotPlot}
\end{figure}

Note that the distribution of these simulated differences is centered around 0. We simulated these differences assuming that the independence model was true, and under this condition, we expect the difference to be zero with some random fluctuation. We would generally be surprised to see a difference of \emph{exactly} 0: sometimes, just by chance, the difference is higher than 0, and other times it is lower than zero.

\begin{example}{How often would you observe a difference of at least 29.2\% (0.292) according to Figure~\ref{discRandDotPlot}? Often, sometimes, rarely, or never?}
It appears that a difference of at least 29.2\% due to chance alone would only happen about 2\% of the time according to Figure~\ref{discRandDotPlot}. Such a low probability indicates a rare event.
\end{example}

\textC{\newpage}

The difference of 29.2\% being a rare event suggests two possible interpretations of the results of the study:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$] \textbf{Independence model.} Gender has no effect on promotion decision, and we observed a difference that would only happen rarely.
\item[$H_A$] \textbf{Alternative model.} Gender has an effect on promotion decision, and what we observed was actually due to equally qualified women being discriminated against in promotion decisions, which explains the large difference of 29.2\%.
\end{itemize}
Based on the simulations, we have two options. (1)~We conclude that the study results do not provide strong evidence against the independence model. That is, we do not have sufficiently strong evidence to conclude there was gender discrimination. (2)~We conclude the evidence is sufficiently strong to reject $H_0$ and assert that there was gender discrimination. When we conduct formal studies, usually we reject the notion that we just happened to observe a rare event.\footnote{This reasoning does not generally extend to anecdotal observations. Each of us observes incredibly rare events every day, events we could not possibly hope to predict. However, in the non-rigorous setting of anecdotal evidence, almost anything may appear to be a rare event, so the idea of looking for rare events in day-to-day activities is treacherous. For example, we might look at the lottery: there was only a 1 in 176 million chance that the Mega Millions numbers for the largest jackpot in history (March 30, 2012) would be (2, 4, 23, 38, 46) with a Mega ball of (23), but nonetheless those numbers came up! However, no matter what numbers had turned up, they would have had the same incredibly rare odds. That is, \emph{any set of numbers we could have observed would ultimately be incredibly rare}. This type of situation is typical of our daily lives: each possible event in itself seems incredibly rare, but if we consider every alternative, those outcomes are also incredibly rare. We should be cautious not to misinterpret such anecdotal evidence.} So in this case, we reject the independence model in favor of the alternative. That is, we are concluding the data provide strong evidence of gender discrimination against women by the supervisors.

\index{data!discrimination|)}

One field of statistics, statistical inference, is built on evaluating whether such differences are due to chance. In statistical inference, statisticians evaluate which model is most reasonable given the data. Errors do occur, just like rare events, and we might choose the wrong model. While we do not always choose correctly, statistical inference gives us tools to control and evaluate how often these errors occur. In Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference}, we give a formal introduction to the problem of model selection. We spend the next two chapters building a foundation of probability and theory necessary to make that discussion rigorous.

treatment or control. 43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture 
that is specifically designed to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control 
group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at non-acupoint 
locations). 24 hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked 
if they were pain free. Results are summarized in the contingency table below.

Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants 
and preterm births in Southern California. During the study air pollution levels 
were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Specifically, levels of carbon 
monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts 
per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM$_{10}$) in $\mu g/m^3$. 
Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 
and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each 
birth. The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM$_{10}$ and, to a lesser 
degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births.

15. Participants reported their age, sex, and whether they were an only child 
or not. The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and 
to record the outcome (white or black) on a paper sheet, and said they 
would only reward children who report white. Half the students were explicitly 
told not to cheat and the others were not given any explicit instructions. In 
the no instruction group probability of cheating was found to be uniform 
across groups based on child's characteristics. In the group that was 
explicitly told to not cheat, girls were less likely to cheat, and while rate 
of cheating didn't vary by age for boys, it decreased with age for girls.

has gained an entirely new reputation as a diet supplement.  In one 2009 study, a team 
of researchers recruited 38 men and divided them randomly into two groups: treatment or 
control. They also recruited 38 women, and they randomly placed half of these 
participants into the treatment group and the other half into the control group. One 
group was given 25 grams of chia seeds twice a day, and the other was given a placebo. 
The subjects volunteered to be a part of the study. After 12 weeks, the scientists found 
no significant difference between the groups in appetite or weight loss.

\item The data suggest that diabetic patients who are taking rosiglitazone are more likely to have cardiovascular problems since the rate of incidence was (2,593 / 67,593 = 0.038) 3.8\% for patients on this treatment, while it was only (5,386 / 159,978 = 0.034) 3.4\% for patients on pioglitazone.
\item The fact that the rate of incidence is higher for the rosiglitazone group proves that rosiglitazone causes serious cardiovascular problems.

\eoce{\qt{Heart transplants\label{randomization_heart_transplants}} The Stanford 
University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an 
experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan. Each patient 
entering the program was designated an official heart transplant candidate, 
meaning that he was gravely ill and would most likely benefit from a new heart. 
Some patients got a transplant and some did not. The variable \texttt{transplant} 
indicates which group the patients were in; patients in the treatment group got a 
transplant and those in the control group did not. Another variable called 
\texttt{survived} was used to indicate whether or not the patient was alive 
at the end of the study. Of the 34 patients in the control group, 30 died. Of the 69 people in the treatment group, 45 died. \footfullcite{Turnbull+Brown+Hu:1974}

\chapter{Probability (special topic)}
\label{probability}

\index{probability|(}

Probability forms a foundation for statistics. You might already be familiar with many aspects of probability, however, formalization of the concepts is new for most. This chapter aims to introduce probability on familiar terms using processes most people have seen before.

\section{Defining probability (special topic)}
\label{basicsOfProbability}

\begin{example}{A ``die'', the singular of dice, is a cube with six faces numbered \resp{1}, \resp{2}, \resp{3}, \resp{4}, \resp{5}, and \resp{6}. What is the chance of getting \resp{1} when rolling a die?}\label{probOf1}
If the die is fair, then the chance of a \resp{1} is as good as the chance of any other number. Since there are six outcomes, the chance must be 1-in-6 or, equivalently, $1/6$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{What is the chance of getting a \resp{1} or \resp{2} in the next roll?}\label{probOf1Or2}
\resp{1} and \resp{2} constitute two of the six equally likely possible outcomes, so the chance of getting one of these two outcomes must be $2/6 = 1/3$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{What is the chance of getting either \resp{1}, \resp{2}, \resp{3}, \resp{4}, \resp{5}, or \resp{6} on the next roll?}\label{probOf123456}
100\%. The outcome must be one of these numbers.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{What is the chance of not rolling a \resp{2}?}\label{probNot2}
Since the chance of rolling a \resp{2} is $1/6$ or $16.\bar{6}\%$, the chance of not rolling a \resp{2} must be $100\% - 16.\bar{6}\%=83.\bar{3}\%$ or $5/6$.

Alternatively, we could have noticed that not rolling a \resp{2} is the same as getting a \resp{1}, \resp{3}, \resp{4}, \resp{5}, or \resp{6}, which makes up five of the six equally likely outcomes and has probability $5/6$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{Consider rolling two dice. If $1/6^{th}$ of the time the first die is a \resp{1} and $1/6^{th}$ of those times the second die is a \resp{1}, what is the chance of getting two \resp{1}s?}\label{probOf2Ones}
If $16.\bar{6}$\% of the time the first die is a \resp{1} and $1/6^{th}$ of \emph{those} times the second die is also a \resp{1}, then the chance that both dice are \resp{1} is $(1/6)\times (1/6)$ or $1/36$.
\end{example}

\subsection{Probability}

\index{random process|(}

We use probability to build tools to describe and understand apparent randomness. We often frame probability in terms of a \term{random process} giving rise to an \term{outcome}.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Roll a die &$\rightarrow$ & \resp{1}, \resp{2}, \resp{3}, \resp{4}, \resp{5}, or \resp{6} \\
Flip a coin &$\rightarrow$ & \resp{H} or \resp{T} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Rolling a die or flipping a coin is a seemingly random process and each gives rise to an outcome. 

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Probability}
The \term{probability} of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.}
\end{termBox}

Probability is defined as a proportion, and it always takes values between 0~and~1 (inclusively). It may also be displayed as a percentage between 0\% and 100\%.

Probability can be illustrated by rolling a die many times. Let $\hat{p}_n$ be the proportion of outcomes that are \resp{1} after the first $n$ rolls. As the number of rolls increases, $\hat{p}_n$ will converge to the probability of rolling a \resp{1}, $p = 1/6$. Figure~\ref{dieProp} shows this convergence for 100,000 die rolls. The tendency of $\hat{p}_n$ to stabilize around $p$ is described by the \term{Law of Large Numbers}. 

\begin{figure}[bt]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{ch_probability/figures/dieProp/dieProp}
\caption{The fraction of die rolls that are 1 at each stage in a simulation. The proportion tends to get closer to the probability $1/6 \approx 0.167$ as the number of rolls increases.}
\label{dieProp}
\end{figure}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Law of Large Numbers}
As more observations are collected, the proportion $\hat{p}_n$ of occurrences with a particular outcome converges to the probability $p$ of that outcome.}
\end{termBox}

Occasionally the proportion will veer off from the probability and appear to defy the Law of Large Numbers, as $\hat{p}_n$ does many times in Figure~\ref{dieProp}. However, these deviations become smaller as the number of rolls increases.

Above we write $p$ as the probability of rolling a \resp{1}. We can also write this probability as
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\text{rolling a \resp{1}})
\end{eqnarray*}
\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-13mm}

$P(A)$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Probability of\\outcome $A$]{\raggedright\vspace{-13mm}

$P(A)$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Probability of\\outcome $A$}As we become more comfortable with this notation, we will abbreviate it further. For instance, if it is clear that the process is ``rolling a die'', we could abbreviate $P($rolling a \resp{1}$)$ as~$P($\resp{1}$)$. 

\begin{exercise} \label{randomProcessExercise}
Random processes include rolling a die and flipping a coin. (a) Think of another random process. (b) Describe all the possible outcomes of that process. For instance, rolling a die is a random process with possible outcomes \mbox{\resp{1}, \resp{2}, ..., \resp{6}}.\footnote{Here are four examples. (i) Whether someone gets sick in the next month or not is an apparently random process with outcomes \resp{sick} and \resp{not}. (ii) We can \emph{generate} a random process by randomly picking a person and measuring that person's height. The outcome of this process will be a positive number. (iii) Whether the stock market goes up or down next week is a seemingly random process with possible outcomes \resp{up}, \resp{down}, and \resp{no\_\hspace{0.3mm}change}. Alternatively, we could have used the percent change in the stock market as a numerical outcome. (iv) Whether your roommate cleans her dishes tonight probably seems like a random process with possible outcomes \resp{cleans\_\hspace{0.3mm}dishes} and \resp{leaves\_\hspace{0.3mm}dishes}.}
\end{exercise}

What we think of as random processes are not necessarily random, but they may just be too difficult to understand exactly. The fourth example in the footnote solution to Guided Practice~\ref{randomProcessExercise} suggests a roommate's behavior is a random process. However, even if a roommate's behavior is not truly random, modeling her behavior as a random process can still be useful. 

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Modeling a process as random}
It can be helpful to model a process as random even if it is not truly random.}
\end{tipBox}

\index{random process|)}

\subsection{Disjoint or mutually exclusive outcomes}

\index{disjoint|(}
\index{mutually exclusive|(}

Two outcomes are called \term{disjoint} or \term{mutually exclusive} if they cannot both happen. For instance, if we roll a die, the outcomes \resp{1} and \resp{2} are disjoint since they cannot both occur. On the other hand, the outcomes \resp{1} and ``rolling an odd number'' are not disjoint since both occur if the outcome of the roll is a \resp{1}. The terms \emph{disjoint} and \emph{mutually exclusive} are equivalent and interchangeable.

Calculating the probability of disjoint outcomes is easy. When rolling a die, the outcomes \resp{1} and \resp{2} are disjoint, and we compute the probability that one of these outcomes will occur by adding their separate probabilities:
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\text{\resp{1} or \resp{2}}) = P(\text{\resp{1}})+P(\text{\resp{2}}) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3
\end{eqnarray*}
What about  the probability of rolling a \resp{1}, \resp{2}, \resp{3}, \resp{4}, \resp{5}, or \resp{6}? Here again, all of the outcomes are disjoint so we add the probabilities:
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&P(\text{\resp{1} or \resp{2} or \resp{3} or \resp{4} or \resp{5} or \resp{6}}) \\
	&&\quad= P(\text{\resp{1}})+P(\text{\resp{2}})+P(\text{\resp{3}})+P(\text{\resp{4}})+P(\text{\resp{5}})+P(\text{\resp{6}}) \\
	&&\quad= 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1.
\end{eqnarray*}
The \term{Addition Rule} guarantees the accuracy of this approach when the outcomes are disjoint. 

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Addition Rule of disjoint outcomes} If $A_1$ and $A_2$ represent two disjoint outcomes, then the probability that one of them occurs is given by
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(A_1\text{ or } A_2) = P(A_1) + P(A_2)
\end{eqnarray*}
If there are many disjoint outcomes $A_1$, ..., $A_k$, then the probability that one of these outcomes will occur is
\begin{eqnarray}
P(A_1) + P(A_2) + \cdots + P(A_k)
\end{eqnarray}
}
\end{termBox}

\begin{exercise}
We are interested in the probability of rolling a \resp{1}, \resp{4}, or \resp{5}. (a) Explain why the outcomes \resp{1}, \resp{4}, and \resp{5} are disjoint. (b) Apply the Addition Rule for disjoint outcomes to determine $P($\resp{1} or \resp{4} or \resp{5}$)$.\footnote{(a) The random process is a die roll, and at most one of these outcomes can come up. This means they are disjoint outcomes. (b)~$P($\resp{1} or \resp{4} or \resp{5}$) = P($\resp{1}$)+P($\resp{4}$)+P($\resp{5}$) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$}
\end{exercise}

\index{data!email|(}
\begin{exercise}
In the \data{email} data set in Chapter~\ref{introductionToData}, the \var{number} variable described whether no number (labeled \resp{none}), only one or more small numbers (\resp{small}), or whether at least one big number appeared in an email (\resp{big}). Of the 3,921 emails, 549 had no numbers, 2,827 had only one or more small numbers, and 545 had at least one big number. (a) Are the outcomes \resp{none}, \resp{small}, and \resp{big} disjoint? (b) Determine the proportion of emails with value \resp{small} and \resp{big} separately. (c) Use the Addition Rule for disjoint outcomes to compute the probability a randomly selected email from the data set has a number in it, small or big.\footnote{(a) Yes. Each email is categorized in only one level of \var{number}. (b) Small: $\frac{2827}{3921} = 0.721$. Big: $\frac{545}{3921} = 0.139$. (c) $P($\resp{small} or \resp{big}$) = P($\resp{small}$) + P($\resp{big}$) = 0.721 + 0.139 = 0.860$.}
\end{exercise}
\index{data!email|)}

\index{event|(}

Statisticians rarely work with individual outcomes and instead consider \indexthis{\emph{sets}}{sets} or \indexthis{\emph{collections}}{collections} of outcomes. Let $A$ represent the event where a die roll results in \resp{1} or \resp{2} and $B$~represent the event that the die roll is a \resp{4} or a \resp{6}. We write $A$ as the set of outcomes $\{$\resp{1},~\resp{2}$\}$ and $B=\{$\resp{4}, \resp{6}$\}$. These sets are commonly called \termsub{events}{event}. Because $A$ and $B$ have no elements in common, they are disjoint events. $A$ and $B$ are represented in Figure~\ref{disjointSets}.

\begin{figure}[hhh]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{ch_probability/figures/disjointSets/disjointSets}
\caption{Three events, $A$, $B$, and $D$, consist of outcomes from rolling a die. $A$ and $B$ are disjoint since they do not have any outcomes in common.}
\label{disjointSets}
\end{figure}

The Addition Rule applies to both disjoint outcomes and disjoint events. The probability that one of the disjoint events $A$ or $B$ occurs is the sum of the separate probabilities:
\begin{align*}
P(A\text{ or }B) = P(A) + P(B) = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3
\end{align*}

\begin{exercise}
(a) Verify the probability of event $A$, $P(A)$, is $1/3$ using the Addition Rule. (b) Do the same for event $B$.\footnote{(a) $P(A) = P($\resp{1} or \resp{2}$) = P($\resp{1}$) + P($\resp{2}$) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$. (b) Similarly, $P(B) = 1/3$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{exerExaminingDisjointSetsABD}
(a) Using Figure~\ref{disjointSets} as a reference, what outcomes are represented by event $D$? (b) Are events $B$ and $D$ disjoint? (c) Are events $A$ and $D$ disjoint?\footnote{(a)~Outcomes \resp{2} and \resp{3}. (b)~Yes, events $B$ and $D$ are disjoint because they share no outcomes. (c)~The events $A$ and $D$ share an outcome in common, \resp{2}, and so are not disjoint.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
In Guided Practice~\ref{exerExaminingDisjointSetsABD}, you confirmed $B$ and $D$ from Figure~\ref{disjointSets} are disjoint. Compute the probability that event $B$ or event $D$~occurs.\footnote{Since $B$ and $D$ are disjoint events, use the Addition Rule: $P(B$ or $D) = P(B) + P(D) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}$.}

\subsection{Probabilities when events are not disjoint}

Let's consider calculations for two events that are not disjoint in the context of a \indexthis{regular deck of 52 cards}{deck of cards}, represented in Table~\ref{deckOfCards}. If you are unfamiliar with the cards in a regular deck, please see the footnote.\footnote{The 52 cards are split into four \term{suits}: $\clubsuit$ (club), {\color{redcards}$\diamondsuit$} (diamond), {\color{redcards}$\heartsuit$} (heart), $\spadesuit$ (spade). Each suit has its 13 cards labeled: \resp{2}, \resp{3}, ..., \resp{10}, \resp{J} (jack), \resp{Q} (queen), \resp{K} (king), and \resp{A} (ace). Thus, each card is a unique combination of a suit and a label, e.g. {\color{redcards}\resp{4$\heartsuit$}} and \resp{J$\clubsuit$}. The 12 cards represented by the jacks, queens, and kings are called \termsub{\resp{face cards}}{face card}. The cards that are {\color{redcards}$\diamondsuit$} or {\color{redcards}$\heartsuit$} are typically colored {\color{redcards}red} while the other two suits are typically colored black.}

\end{table}

\begin{exercise}
(a) What is the probability that a randomly selected card is a diamond? (b)~What is the probability that a randomly selected card is a face card?\footnote{(a) There are 52 cards and 13 diamonds. If the cards are thoroughly shuffled, each card has an equal chance of being drawn, so the probability that a randomly selected card is a diamond is $P({\color{redcards}\diamondsuit}) = \frac{13}{52} = 0.250$. (b)~Likewise, there are 12 face cards, so $P($face card$) = \frac{12}{52} = \frac{3}{13} = 0.231$.}
\end{exercise}

\term{Venn diagrams} are useful when outcomes can be categorized as ``in'' or ``out'' for two or three variables, attributes, or random processes. The Venn diagram in Figure~\ref{cardsDiamondFaceVenn} uses a circle to represent diamonds and another to represent face cards. If a card is both a diamond and a face card, it falls into the intersection of the circles. If it is a diamond but not a face card, it will be in part of the left circle that is not in the right circle (and so on). The total number of cards that are diamonds is given by the total number of cards in the diamonds circle: $10+3=13$. The probabilities are also shown (e.g. $10/52 = 0.1923$).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{ch_probability/figures/cardsDiamondFaceVenn/cardsDiamondFaceVenn}
\caption{A Venn diagram for diamonds and face cards.}
\label{cardsDiamondFaceVenn}
\end{figure}

%\begin{exercise}
%Using Figure~\ref{cardsDiamondFaceVenn}, verify $P($face card$) = 12/52=3/13$.\footnote{The Venn diagram shows face cards split up into ``face card but not {\color{redcards}$\diamondsuit$}'' and ``face card and {\color{redcards}$\diamondsuit$}''. Since these correspond to disjoint events, $P($face card$)$ is found by adding the two corresponding probabilities: $\frac{3}{52} + \frac{9}{52} = \frac{12}{52} = \frac{3}{13}$.}
%\end{exercise}

Let $A$ represent the event that a randomly selected card is a diamond and $B$ represent the event that it is a face card. How do we compute $P(A$ or $B)$? Events $A$ and $B$ are not disjoint -- the cards {\color{redcards}$J\diamondsuit$}, {\color{redcards}$Q\diamondsuit$}, and {\color{redcards}$K\diamondsuit$} fall into both categories -- so we cannot use the Addition Rule for disjoint events. Instead we use the Venn diagram. We start by adding the probabilities of the two events:
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(A) + P(B)
  = P({\color{redcards}\diamondsuit}) + P(\text{face card})
  = 13/52 + 12/52
\label{overCountFaceDiamond}
\end{eqnarray*}
However, the three cards that are in both events were counted twice, once in each probability. We must correct this double counting:
\begin{eqnarray}
P(A\text{ or } B) &=&P({\color{redcards}\diamondsuit}\text{ or face card})  \notag \\
  &=& P({\color{redcards}\diamondsuit}) + P(\text{face card}) - P({\color{redcards}\diamondsuit}\text{ and face card}) \label{diamondFace} \\
  &=& 13/52 + 12/52 - 3/52 \notag \\
  &=& 22/52 = 11/26 \notag

Equation~(\ref{diamondFace}) is an example of the \term{General Addition Rule}.

\subsection{Probability distributions}


A \term{probability distribution} is a table of all disjoint outcomes and their associated probabilities. Table~\ref{diceProb} shows the probability distribution for the sum of two dice. 

\begin{table}[h] \small
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l ccc ccc ccc cc}
  \hline
  \ \vspace{-3mm} \\
Dice sum\vspace{0.3mm} & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12  \\
Probability & $\frac{1}{36}$ & $\frac{2}{36}$ & $\frac{3}{36}$ & $\frac{4}{36}$ & $\frac{5}{36}$ & $\frac{6}{36}$ & $\frac{5}{36}$ & $\frac{4}{36}$ & $\frac{3}{36}$ & $\frac{2}{36}$ & $\frac{1}{36}$\vspace{1mm} \\
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Probability distribution for the sum of two dice.}
\label{diceProb}
\end{table}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Rules for probability distributions}
A probability distribution is a list of the possible outcomes with corresponding probabilities that satisfies three rules: \vspace{-2mm}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item The outcomes listed must be disjoint.
\item Each probability must be between 0 and 1.
\item The probabilities must total 1. \vspace{1mm}
\end{enumerate}}
\end{termBox}

\begin{exercise}\label{usHouseholdIncomeDistsExercise}
Table~\ref{usHouseholdIncomeDists} suggests three distributions for household income in the United States. Only one is correct. Which one must it be? What is wrong with the other two?\footnote{The probabilities of (a) do not sum to 1. The second probability in (b) is negative. This leaves (c), which sure enough satisfies the requirements of a distribution. One of the three was said to be the actual distribution of US household incomes, so it must be (c).}
\end{exercise}

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{r | rr rr}
  \hline
Income range (\$1000s) & 0-25    & 25-50    & 50-100     & 100+    \\
  \hline
(a)\hspace{0.2mm}	 & 0.18 & 0.39 & 0.33 & 0.16 \\
(b)				 & 0.38 & -0.27 & 0.52 & 0.37 \\

  \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Proposed distributions of US household incomes (Guided Practice~\ref{usHouseholdIncomeDistsExercise}).}
\label{usHouseholdIncomeDists}
\end{table}

Chapter~\ref{introductionToData} emphasized the importance of plotting data to provide quick summaries. Probability distributions can also be summarized in a bar plot. For instance, the distribution of US household incomes is shown in Figure~\ref{usHouseholdIncomeDistBar} as a bar plot. %\footnote{It is also possible to construct a distribution plot when income is not artificially binned into four groups. \emph{Continuous} distributions are considered in Section~\ref{contDist}.}
The probability distribution for the sum of two dice is shown in Table~\ref{diceProb} and plotted in Figure~\ref{diceSumDist}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.68\textwidth]{ch_probability/figures/usHouseholdIncomeDistBar/usHouseholdIncomeDistBar}

\caption{The probability distribution of the sum of two dice.}
\label{diceSumDist}
\end{figure}

In these bar plots, the bar heights represent the probabilities of outcomes. If the outcomes are numerical and discrete, it is usually (visually) convenient to make a bar plot that resembles a histogram, as in the case of the sum of two dice. Another example of plotting the bars at their respective locations is shown in Figure~\ref{bookCostDist} on page~\pageref{bookCostDist}.

\subsection{Complement of an event}

Rolling a die produces a value in the set $\{$\resp{1}, \resp{2}, \resp{3}, \resp{4}, \resp{5}, \resp{6}$\}$. This set of all possible outcomes is called the \term{sample space} ($S$)\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-5mm}

$S$\\\footnotesize Sample space]{\raggedright\vspace{-5mm}

$S$\\\footnotesize Sample space}\index{S@$S$} for rolling a die. We often use the sample space to examine the scenario where an event does not occur.

Let $D=\{$\resp{2}, \resp{3}$\}$ represent the event that the outcome of a die roll is \resp{2} or \resp{3}. Then the \term{complement}\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{0.2mm}

$A^c$\\\footnotesize Complement\\of outcome $A$]{\raggedright\vspace{0.2mm}

$A^c$\\\footnotesize Complement\\of outcome $A$}\index{Ac@$A^c$} of $D$ represents all outcomes in our sample space that are not in $D$, which is denoted by $D^c = \{$\resp{1}, \resp{4}, \resp{5}, \resp{6}$\}$. That is, $D^c$ is the set of all possible outcomes not already included in $D$. Figure~\ref{complementOfD} shows the relationship between $D$, $D^c$, and the sample space $S$. 

\begin{figure}[hht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{ch_probability/figures/complementOfD/complementOfD}
\caption{Event $D=\{$\resp{2}, \resp{3}$\}$ and its complement, $D^c = \{$\resp{1}, \resp{4}, \resp{5}, \resp{6}$\}$. $S$~represents the sample space, which is the set of all possible events.}
\label{complementOfD}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
(a) Compute $P(D^c) = P($rolling a \resp{1}, \resp{4}, \resp{5}, or \resp{6}$)$. (b) What is $P(D) + P(D^c)$?\footnote{(a)~The outcomes are disjoint and each has probability $1/6$, so the total probability is $4/6=2/3$. (b)~We can also see that $P(D)=\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = 1/3$. Since $D$ and $D^c$ are disjoint, $P(D) + P(D^c) = 1$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Events $A=\{$\resp{1}, \resp{2}$\}$ and $B=\{$\resp{4}, \resp{6}$\}$ are shown in Figure~\ref{disjointSets} on page~\pageref{disjointSets}. (a) Write out what $A^c$ and $B^c$ represent. (b)~Compute $P(A^c)$ and $P(B^c)$. (c)~Compute $P(A)+P(A^c)$ and $P(B)+P(B^c)$.\footnote{Brief solutions: (a)~$A^c=\{$\resp{3}, \resp{4}, \resp{5}, \resp{6}$\}$ and $B^c=\{$\resp{1}, \resp{2}, \resp{3}, \resp{5}$\}$. (b)~Noting that each outcome is disjoint, add the individual outcome probabilities to get $P(A^c)=2/3$ and $P(B^c)=2/3$. (c)~$A$~and~$A^c$ are disjoint, and the same is true of $B$~and~$B^c$. Therefore, $P(A) + P(A^c) = 1$ and $P(B) + P(B^c) = 1$.}
\end{exercise}

A complement of an event $A$ is constructed to have two very important properties: (i) every possible outcome not in $A$ is in $A^c$, and (ii) $A$ and $A^c$ are disjoint. Property (i) implies
\begin{eqnarray}
P(A\text{ or }A^c) = 1
\label{complementSumTo1}
\end{eqnarray}
That is, if the outcome is not in $A$, it must be represented in $A^c$. We use the Addition Rule for disjoint events to apply Property (ii):
\begin{eqnarray}
P(A\text{ or }A^c) = P(A) + P(A^c)
\label{complementDisjointEquation}
\end{eqnarray}
Combining Equations~(\ref{complementSumTo1}) and~(\ref{complementDisjointEquation}) yields a very useful relationship between the probability of an event and its complement.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Complement}
The complement of event $A$ is denoted $A^c$, and $A^c$ represents all outcomes not in~$A$. $A$ and $A^c$ are mathematically related: \vspace{-2mm}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{complement}
P(A) + P(A^c) = 1, \quad\text{i.e.}\quad P(A) = 1-P(A^c)
\end{eqnarray}\vspace{-6.5mm}}
\end{termBox}

In simple examples, computing $A$ or $A^c$ is feasible in a few steps. However, using the complement can save a lot of time as problems grow in complexity.

\begin{exercise}
Let $A$ represent the event where we roll two dice and their total is less than \resp{12}. (a) What does the event $A^c$ represent? (b) Determine $P(A^c)$ from Table~\ref{diceProb} on page~\pageref{diceProb}. (c) Determine $P(A)$.\footnote{(a)~The complement of $A$: when the total is equal to \resp{12}. (b)~$P(A^c) = 1/36$. (c)~Use the probability of the complement from part (b), $P(A^c) = 1/36$, and Equation~(\ref{complement}): $P($less than \resp{12}$) = 1 - P($\resp{12}$) = 1 - 1/36 = 35/36$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} Consider again the probabilities from Table~\ref{diceProb} and rolling two dice. Find the following probabilities: (a)~The sum of the dice is \emph{not} \resp{6}. (b)~The sum is at least \resp{4}. That is, determine the probability of the event $B=\{$\resp{4}, \resp{5}, ..., \resp{12}$\}$. (c) The sum is no more than \resp{10}. That is, determine the probability of the event $D=\{$\resp{2}, \resp{3}, ..., \resp{10}$\}$.\footnote{(a)~First find $P($\resp{6}$)=5/36$, then use the complement: $P($not \resp{6}$) = 1 - P($\resp{6}$) = 31/36$.

(b)~First find  the complement, which requires much less effort: $P($\resp{2} or \resp{3}$)=1/36+2/36=1/12$. Then calculate $P(B) = 1-P(B^c) = 1-1/12 = 11/12$.

(c)~As before, finding the complement is the clever way to determine $P(D)$. First find $P(D^c) = P($\resp{11} or \resp{12}$)=2/36 + 1/36=1/12$. Then calculate $P(D) = 1 - P(D^c) = 11/12$.}
\end{exercise}


\subsection{Independence}
\label{probabilityIndependence}

Just as variables and observations can be independent, random processes can be independent, too. Two processes are \term{independent} if knowing the outcome of one provides no useful information about the outcome of the other. For instance, flipping a coin and rolling a die are two independent processes -- knowing the coin was heads does not help determine the outcome of a die roll. On the other hand, stock prices usually move up or down together, so they are not independent.

Example~\ref{probOf2Ones} provides a basic example of two independent processes: rolling two dice. We want to determine the probability that both will be \resp{1}. Suppose one of the dice is red and the other white. If the outcome of the red die is a \resp{1}, it provides no information about the outcome of the white die. We first encountered this same question in Example~\ref{probOf2Ones} (page~\pageref{probOf2Ones}), where we calculated the probability using the following reasoning: $1/6^{th}$ of the time the red die is a \resp{1}, and $1/6^{th}$ of \emph{those} times the white die will also be \resp{1}. This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{indepForRollingTwo1s}. Because the rolls are independent, the probabilities of the corresponding outcomes can be multiplied to get the final answer: $(1/6)\times(1/6)=1/36$. This can be generalized to many independent processes. 

\begin{figure}[hht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ch_probability/figures/indepForRollingTwo1s/indepForRollingTwo1s}
\caption{$1/6^{th}$ of the time, the first roll is a \resp{1}. Then $1/6^{th}$ of \emph{those} times, the second roll will also be a \resp{1}.}
\label{indepForRollingTwo1s}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}{What if there was also a blue die independent of the other two? What is the probability of rolling the three dice and getting all \resp{1}s?}\label{threeDice}
The same logic applies from Example~\ref{probOf2Ones}. If $1/36^{th}$ of the time the white and red dice are both \resp{1}, then $1/6^{th}$ of \emph{those} times the blue die will also be \resp{1}, so multiply:
{\begin{align*}
P(white=\text{\small\resp{1} and } red=\text{\small\resp{1} and } blue=\text{\small\resp{1}})
	&= P(white=\text{\small\resp{1}})\times P(red=\text{\small\resp{1}})\times P(blue=\text{\small\resp{1}}) \\
	&= (1/6)\times (1/6)\times (1/6)
	= 1/216
\end{align*}} \vspace{-7mm}
\end{example}

Example~\ref{threeDice} illustrates what is called the Multiplication Rule for independent processes. 

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{\term{Multiplication Rule} for independent processes}
If $A$ and $B$ represent events from two different and independent processes, then the probability that both $A$ and $B$ occur can be calculated as the product of their separate probabilities: \vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqForIndependentEvents}
P(A \text{ and }B) = P(A) \times  P(B)
\end{eqnarray}
Similarly, if there are $k$ events $A_1$, ..., $A_k$ from $k$ independent processes, then the probability they all occur is\vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(A_1) \times  P(A_2)\times  \cdots \times  P(A_k)
\end{eqnarray*}\vspace{-6mm}}
\end{termBox}

\begin{exercise} \label{ex2Handedness}
About 9\% of people are left-handed. Suppose 2 people are selected at random from the U.S. population. Because the sample size of 2 is very small relative to the population, it is reasonable to assume these two people are independent. (a)~What is the probability that both are left-handed? (b)~What is the probability that both are right-handed?\footnote{(a) The probability the first person is left-handed is $0.09$, which is the same for the second person. We apply the Multiplication Rule for independent processes to determine the probability that both will be left-handed: $0.09\times 0.09 = 0.0081$.

(b) It is reasonable to assume the proportion of people who are ambidextrous (both right and left handed) is nearly 0, which results in $P($right-handed$)=1-0.09=0.91$. Using the same reasoning as in part~(a), the probability that both will be right-handed is $0.91\times 0.91 = 0.8281$.}
\end{exercise}

\textC{\newpage}

\begin{exercise} \label{ex5Handedness}
Suppose 5 people are selected at random.\footnote{(a)~The abbreviations \resp{RH} and \resp{LH} are used for right-handed and left-handed, respectively. Since each are independent, we apply the Multiplication Rule for independent processes:
\begin{align*}
P(\text{all five are \resp{RH}})
&= P(\text{first = \resp{RH}, second = \resp{RH}, ..., fifth = \resp{RH}}) \\
&= P(\text{first = \resp{RH}})\times P(\text{second = \resp{RH}})\times  \dots \times P(\text{fifth = \resp{RH}}) \\
&= 0.91\times 0.91\times 0.91\times 0.91\times 0.91 = 0.624
\end{align*}

(b)~Using the same reasoning as in~(a), $0.09\times 0.09\times 0.09\times 0.09\times 0.09 = 0.0000059$

(c)~Use the complement, $P($all five are \resp{RH}$)$, to answer this question:
\begin{align*}
P(\text{not all \resp{RH}})
	= 1 - P(\text{all \resp{RH}})
	= 1 - 0.624 = 0.376
\end{align*}} \vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[(a)] What is the probability that all are right-handed?
\item[(b)] What is the probability that all are left-handed?
\item[(c)] What is the probability that not all of the people are right-handed?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

Suppose the variables \var{handedness} and \var{gender} are independent, i.e. knowing someone's \var{gender} provides no useful information about their \var{handedness} and vice-versa. Then we can compute whether a randomly selected person is right-handed and female\footnote{The actual proportion of the U.S. population that is \resp{female} is about 50\%, and so we use 0.5 for the probability of sampling a woman. However, this probability does differ in other countries.} using the Multiplication Rule:
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\text{right-handed and female}) &=& P(\text{right-handed}) \times  P(\text{female}) \\
&=& 0.91 \times  0.50 = 0.455
\end{eqnarray*}


\begin{exercise}
Three people are selected at random.\footnote{Brief answers are provided. (a)~This can be written in probability notation as $P($a randomly selected person is male and right-handed$)=0.455$. (b) 0.207. (c) 0.045. (d) 0.0093.} \vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[(a)] What is the probability that the first person is male and right-handed?
\item[(b)] What is the probability that the first two people are male and right-handed?.
\item[(c)] What is the probability that the third person is female and left-handed?
\item[(d)] What is the probability that the first two people are male and right-handed and the third person is female and left-handed?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

Sometimes we wonder if one outcome provides useful information about another outcome. The question we are asking is, are the occurrences of the two events independent? We say that two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if they satisfy Equation~\eqref{eqForIndependentEvents}.

\begin{example}{If we shuffle up a deck of cards and draw one, is the event that the card is a heart independent of the event that the card is an ace?}
The probability the card is a heart is $1/4$ and the probability that it is an ace is $1/13$. The probability the card is the ace of hearts is $1/52$. We check whether Equation~\ref{eqForIndependentEvents} is satisfied:
\begin{align*}
P({\color{redcards}\heartsuit})\times P(\text{ace}) = \frac{1}{4}\times \frac{1}{13} = \frac{1}{52} 
					= P({\color{redcards}\heartsuit}\text{ and ace})
\end{align*}
Because the equation holds, the event that the card is a heart and the event that the card is an ace are independent events.
\end{example}

The \data{family\_\hspace{0.3mm}college} data set contains a sample of 792 cases with two variables, \var{teen} and \var{parents}, and is summarized in Table~\ref{contTableOfParStCollege}.\footnote{A simulated data set based on real population summaries at \oiRedirect{textbook-student_parent_college_2001}{nces.ed.gov/pubs2001/2001126.pdf}.} The \var{teen} variable is either \resp{college} or \resp{not}, where the \var{college} label means the teen went to college immediately after high school. The~\var{parents} variable takes the value \resp{degree} if at least one parent of the teenager completed a college degree.

\end{figure}

\begin{example}{If at least one parent of a teenager completed a college degree, what is the chance the teenager attended college right after high school?}
We can estimate this probability using the data. Of the 280 cases in this data set where \var{parents} takes value \resp{degree}, 231 represent cases where the \var{teen} variable takes value \resp{college}:
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\text{\var{teen} \resp{college} given \var{parents} \resp{degree}}) = \frac{231}{280} = 0.825
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{example}

\begin{example}{A teenager is randomly selected from the sample and she did not attend college right after high school. What is the probability that at least one of her parents has a college degree?}\label{collegeProbOfParentsGivenStudentNot}
If the teenager did not attend, then she is one of the 347 teens in the second row. Of~these 347 teens, 49 had at least one parent who got a college degree:
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\text{\var{parents} \resp{degree} given \var{teen} \resp{not}}) = \frac{49}{347} = 0.141
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{example}

\subsection{Marginal and joint probabilities}
\label{marginalAndJointProbabilities}

\index{marginal probability|(}
\index{joint probability|(}

Table~\ref{contTableOfParStCollege} includes row and column totals for each variable separately in the \data{family\_\hspace{0.3mm}college} data set. These totals represent \termsub{marginal probabilities}{marginal probability} for the sample, which are the probabilities based on a single variable without regard to any other variables. For instance, a probability based solely on the \var{teen} variable is a marginal probability:
\begin{align*}
P(\text{\var{teen} \resp{college}}) = \frac{445}{792} = 0.56
\end{align*}
A probability of outcomes for two or more variables or processes is called a \termsub{joint \mbox{probability}}{joint probability}:
\begin{align*}
P(\text{\var{teen} \resp{college} and \var{parents} \resp{not}}) = \frac{214}{792} = 0.27
\end{align*}
It is common to substitute a comma for ``and'' in a joint probability, although either is acceptable. That is,
\begin{center}
$P(\text{\var{teen} \resp{college}, \var{parents} \resp{not}})$ \\[2mm]
means the same thing as \\[2mm]
$P(\text{\var{teen} \resp{college} and \var{parents} \resp{not}})$
\end{center}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Marginal and joint probabilities}
If a probability is based on a single variable, it is a \emph{\hiddenterm{marginal probability}}. The probability of outcomes for two or more variables or processes is called a \emph{\hiddenterm{joint probability}}.}
\end{termBox}

We use \term{table proportions} to summarize joint probabilities for the \data{family\_\hspace{0.3mm}college} sample. These proportions are computed by dividing each count in Table~\ref{contTableOfParStCollege} by the table's total, 792, to obtain the proportions in Table~\ref{familyCollegeProbTable}. The joint probability distribution of the \var{parents} and \var{teen} variables is shown in Table~\ref{familyCollegeDistribution}.

Verify Table~\ref{familyCollegeDistribution} represents a probability distribution: events are disjoint, all probabilities are non-negative, and the probabilities sum to~1.\footnote{Each of the four outcome combination are disjoint, all probabilities are indeed non-negative, and the sum of the probabilities is $0.29 + 0.06 + 0.27 + 0.38 = 1.00$.}
\end{exercise}

We can compute marginal probabilities using joint probabilities in simple cases. For example, the probability a random teenager from the study went to college is found by summing the outcomes where \var{teen} takes value \resp{college}:\index{marginal probability|)}\index{joint probability|)}
\begin{align*}
P(\text{\underline{\color{black}\var{teen} \resp{college}}})
&=  P(\text{\var{parents} \resp{degree} and \underline{\color{black}\var{teen} \resp{college}}}) \\
& \quad \quad + P(\text{\var{parents} \resp{not} and \underline{\color{black}\var{teen} \resp{college}}}) \\
&= 0.29 + 0.27 \\
&= 0.56
\end{align*}


\subsection{Defining conditional probability}

\index{conditional probability|(}

There is some connection between education level of parents and of the teenager: a college degree by a parent is associated with college attendance of the teenager. In this section, we discuss how to use information about associations between two variables to improve probability estimation.

The probability that a random teenager from the study attended college is 0.56. Could we update this probability if we knew that one of the teen's parents has a college degree? Absolutely. To do so, we limit our view to only those 280 cases where a parent has a college degree and look at the fraction where the teenager attended college:
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\text{\var{teen} \resp{college} given \var{parents} \resp{degree}}) = \frac{231}{280} = 0.825
\end{eqnarray*}
We call this a \term{conditional probability} because we computed the probability under a condition: a parent has a college degree. There are two parts to a conditional probability, the \term{outcome of interest} and the \term{condition}. It is useful to think of the condition as information we know to be true, and this information usually can be described as a known outcome or~event.

We separate the text inside our probability notation into the outcome of interest and the condition:
\begin{eqnarray}
&& P(\text{\var{teen} \resp{college} given \var{parents} \resp{degree}}) \notag \\
&& = P(\text{\var{teen} \resp{college}}\ |\ \text{\var{parents} \resp{degree}}) = \frac{231}{280} = 0.825
\label{probStudentUsedIfParentsUsedInFormalNotation}
\end{eqnarray}
\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-10mm}

$P(A | B)$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Probability of\\outcome $A$\\given $B$]{\raggedright\vspace{-10mm}

$P(A | B)$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Probability of\\outcome $A$\\given $B$}The vertical bar ``$|$'' is read as \emph{given}.

In Equation~\eqref{probStudentUsedIfParentsUsedInFormalNotation}, we computed the probability a teen attended college based on the condition that at least one parent has a college degree as a fraction:\vspaceB{-1mm}
\begin{eqnarray}
&& P(\text{\var{teen} \resp{college}}\ |\ \text{\var{parents} \resp{degree}}) \notag \\
&&\quad = \frac{\text{\# cases where \var{teen} \resp{college} and \var{parents} \resp{degree}}}{\text{\# cases where \var{parents} \resp{degree}}} \label{ratioOfBothToRatioOfConditionalForParentsAndStudent} \\
&&\quad = \frac{231}{280} = 0.825 \notag
\end{eqnarray}
We considered only those cases that met the condition, \var{parents} \resp{degree}, and then we computed the ratio of those cases that satisfied our outcome of interest, the teenager attended college.

Frequently, marginal and joint probabilities are provided instead of count data. For example, disease rates are commonly listed in percentages rather than in a count format. We would like to be able to compute conditional probabilities even when no counts are available, and we use Equation~\eqref{ratioOfBothToRatioOfConditionalForParentsAndStudent} as a template to understand this technique.

We considered only those cases that satisfied the condition, \var{parents} \resp{degree}. Of these cases, the conditional probability was the fraction who represented the outcome of interest, \var{teen} \resp{college}. Suppose we were provided only the information in Table~\ref{familyCollegeProbTable}, i.e. only probability data. Then if we took a sample of 1000 people, we would anticipate about 35\% or $0.35\times 1000 = 350$ would meet the information criterion (\var{parents} \resp{degree}). Similarly, we would expect about 29\% or $0.29\times 1000 = 290$ to meet both the information criteria and represent our outcome of interest. Then the conditional probability can be computed as
\begin{align}
&P(\text{\var{teen} \resp{college}}\ |\ \text{\var{parents} \resp{degree}}) \notag \\
	&= \frac{\text{\# (\var{teen} \resp{college} and \var{parents} \resp{degree})}}{\text{\# (\var{parents} \resp{degree})}} \notag \\
	&= \frac{290}{350}
		= \frac{0.29}{0.35}
		= 0.829\quad\text{(different from 0.825 due to rounding error)}
\label{stUserPUsedHypSampSize}
\end{align}
In Equation~(\ref{stUserPUsedHypSampSize}), we examine exactly the fraction of two probabilities, 0.29 and 0.35, which we can write as
\begin{align*}
P(\text{\var{teen} \resp{college} and \var{parents} \resp{degree}})
	\quad\text{and}\quad
	P(\text{\var{parents} \resp{degree}}).
\end{align*}
The fraction of these probabilities is an example of the general formula for conditional probability.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Conditional probability}
The conditional probability of the outcome of interest $A$ given condition $B$ is computed as the following:
\begin{align}
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A\text{ and }B)}{P(B)}

Then the ratio represents the conditional probability: $0.38 / 0.44 = 0.864$.}

\subsection{Smallpox in Boston, 1721}

\index{data!smallpox|(}

The \data{smallpox} data set provides a sample of 6,224 individuals from the year 1721 who were exposed to smallpox in Boston.\footnote{Fenner F. 1988. \emph{Smallpox and Its Eradication (History of International Public Health, No. 6)}. Geneva: World Health Organization. ISBN 92-4-156110-6.} Doctors at the time believed that inoculation, which involves exposing a person to the disease in a controlled form, could reduce the likelihood of death.

Each case represents one person with two variables: \var{inoculated} and \var{result}. The variable \var{inoculated} takes two levels: \resp{yes} or \resp{no}, indicating whether the person was inoculated or not. The variable \var{result} has outcomes \resp{lived} or \resp{died}. These data are summarized in Tables~\ref{smallpoxContingencyTable} and~\ref{smallpoxProbabilityTable}.

\subsection{General multiplication rule}

Section~\ref{probabilityIndependence} introduced the Multiplication Rule for independent processes. Here we provide the \term{General Multiplication Rule} for events that might not be independent.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{General Multiplication Rule}
If $A$ and $B$ represent two outcomes or events, then \vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(A\text{ and }B) = P(A | B)\times P(B)
\end{eqnarray*} \vspace{-6.5mm} \par
It is useful to think of $A$ as the outcome of interest and $B$ as the condition.}
\end{termBox}
This General Multiplication Rule is simply a rearrangement of the definition for conditional probability in Equation~(\ref{condProbEq}) on page~\pageref{condProbEq}.

\begin{example}{Consider the \data{smallpox} data set. Suppose we are given only two pieces of information: 96.08\% of residents were not inoculated, and 85.88\% of the residents who were not inoculated ended up surviving. How could we compute the probability that a resident was not inoculated and lived?}
We will compute our answer using the General Multiplication Rule and then verify it using Table~\ref{smallpoxProbabilityTable}. We want to determine
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\text{\var{result} = \resp{lived} and \var{inoculated} = \resp{no}})
\end{eqnarray*}
and we are given that
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\text{\var{result} = \resp{lived} }|\text{ \var{inoculated} = \resp{no}})=0.8588 \\
P(\text{\var{inoculated} = \resp{no}})=0.9608
\end{eqnarray*}
Among the 96.08\% of people who were not inoculated, 85.88\% survived:
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\text{\var{result} = \resp{lived} and \var{inoculated} = \resp{no}}) = 0.8588\times 0.9608 = 0.8251
\end{eqnarray*}
This is equivalent to the General Multiplication Rule. We can confirm this probability in Table~\ref{smallpoxProbabilityTable} at the intersection of \resp{no} and \resp{lived} (with a small rounding error).
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Use $P($\var{inoculated} = \resp{yes}$) = 0.0392$ and $P($\var{result} = \resp{lived} $|$ \var{inoculated} = \resp{yes}$) = 0.9754$ to determine the probability that a person was both inoculated and lived.\footnote{The answer is 0.0382, which can be verified using Table~\ref{smallpoxProbabilityTable}.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
If 97.54\% of the people who were inoculated lived, what proportion of inoculated people must have died?\footnote{There were only two possible outcomes: \resp{lived} or \resp{died}. This means that 100\% - 97.45\% = 2.55\% of the people who were inoculated died.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Sum of conditional probabilities}
Let $A_1$, ..., $A_k$ represent all the disjoint outcomes for a variable or process. Then if $B$ is an event, possibly for another variable or process, we have: \vspace{-1mm}
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(A_1|B)+\cdots+P(A_k|B) = 1
\end{eqnarray*}\vspace{-5.5mm} \par
The rule for complements also holds when an event and its complement are conditioned on the same information: \vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(A | B) = 1 - P(A^c | B)
\end{eqnarray*}}
\end{termBox}

\begin{exercise}
Based on the probabilities computed above, does it appear that inoculation is effective at reducing the risk of death from smallpox?\footnote{The samples are large relative to the difference in death rates for the ``inoculated'' and ``not inoculated'' groups, so it seems there is an association between \var{inoculated} and \var{outcome}. However, as noted in the solution to Guided Practice~\ref{SmallpoxInoculationObsExpExercise}, this is an observational study and we cannot be sure if there is a causal connection. (Further research has shown that inoculation is effective at reducing death rates.)}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Independence considerations in conditional probability}

If two events are independent, then knowing the outcome of one should provide no information about the other. We can show this is mathematically true using conditional probabilities.

\begin{exercise} \label{condProbOfRollingA1AfterOne1}
Let $X$ and $Y$ represent the outcomes of rolling two dice.\footnote{Brief solutions: (a) $1/6$. (b) $1/36$. (c)~$\frac{P(Y = \text{ \resp{1} and }X=\text{ \resp{1}})}{P(X=\text{ \resp{1}})} = \frac{1/36}{1/6} = 1/6$. (d)~The probability is the same as in part~(c): $P(Y=1)=1/6$. The probability that $Y=1$ was unchanged by knowledge about $X$, which makes sense as $X$ and $Y$ are independent.}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item What is the probability that the first die, $X$, is \resp{1}?
\item What is the probability that both $X$ and $Y$ are \resp{1}?
\item Use the formula for conditional probability to compute $P(Y =$ \resp{1}$\ |\ X = $ \resp{1}$)$.
\item What is $P(Y=1)$? Is this different from the answer from part (c)? Explain.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\textC{\newpage}

We can show in Guided Practice~\ref{condProbOfRollingA1AfterOne1}(c) that the conditioning information has no influence by using the Multiplication Rule for independence processes:
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(Y=\text{\resp{1}}\ |\ X=\text{\resp{1}})
	&=& \frac{P(Y=\text{\resp{1} and }X=\text{\resp{1}})}{P(X=\text{\resp{1}})} \\
	&=& \frac{P(Y=\text{\resp{1}})\times \color{oiGB}P(X=\text{\resp{1}})}{\color{oiGB}P(X=\text{\resp{1}})} \\
	&=& P(Y=\text{\resp{1}}) \\
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{exercise}
Ron is watching a roulette table in a casino and notices that the last five outcomes were \resp{black}. He figures that the chances of getting \resp{black} six times in a row is very small (about $1/64$) and puts his paycheck on red. What is wrong with his reasoning?\footnote{He has forgotten that the next roulette spin is independent of the previous spins. Casinos do employ this practice; they post the last several outcomes of many betting games to trick unsuspecting gamblers into believing the odds are in their favor. This is called the \term{gambler's fallacy}.}
\end{exercise}


\subsection{Tree diagrams}

\index{data!smallpox|)}
\index{tree diagram|(}

\termsub{Tree diagrams}{tree diagram} are a tool to organize outcomes and probabilities around the structure of the data. They are most useful when two or more processes occur in a sequence and each process is conditioned on its predecessors.

The \data{smallpox} data fit this description. We see the population as split by \var{inoculation}: \resp{yes} and \resp{no}. Following this split, survival rates were observed for each group. This structure is reflected in the \term{tree diagram} shown in Figure~\ref{smallpoxTreeDiagram}. The first branch for \var{inoculation} is said to be the \term{primary} branch while the other branches are \term{secondary}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.93\textwidth]{ch_probability/figures/smallpoxTreeDiagram/smallpoxTreeDiagram}
\caption{A tree diagram of the \data{smallpox} data set.}
\label{smallpoxTreeDiagram}
\end{figure}

Tree diagrams are annotated with marginal and conditional probabilities, as shown in Figure~\ref{smallpoxTreeDiagram}. This tree diagram splits the smallpox data by \var{inoculation} into the \resp{yes} and \resp{no} groups with respective marginal probabilities 0.0392 and 0.9608. The secondary branches are conditioned on the first, so we assign conditional probabilities to these branches. For example, the top branch in Figure~\ref{smallpoxTreeDiagram} is the probability that \var{result} = \resp{lived} conditioned on the information that \var{inoculated} = \resp{yes}. We may (and usually do) construct joint probabilities at the end of each branch in our tree by multiplying the numbers we come across as we move from left to right. These joint probabilities are computed using the General Multiplication Rule:
\begin{eqnarray*}
&& P(\text{\var{inoculated} = \resp{yes} and \var{result} = \resp{lived}}) \\
	&&\quad = P(\text{\var{inoculated} = \resp{yes}})\times P(\text{\var{result} = \resp{lived}}|\text{\var{inoculated} = \resp{yes}}) \\
	&&\quad = 0.0392\times 0.9754=0.0382
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{example}{Consider the midterm and final for a statistics class. Suppose 13\% of students earned an \resp{A} on the midterm. Of those students who earned an \resp{A} on the midterm, 47\% received an \resp{A} on the final, and 11\% of the students who earned lower than an \resp{A} on the midterm received an \resp{A} on the final. You randomly pick up a final exam and notice the student received an \resp{A}. What is the probability that this student earned an \resp{A} on the midterm?} \label{exerciseForTreeDiagramOfStudentGettingAOnMidtermGivenThatSheGotAOnFinal}
The end-goal is to find $P(\text{\var{midterm} = \resp{A}} | \text{\var{final} = \resp{A}})$. To calculate this conditional probability, we need the following probabilities:
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\text{\var{midterm} = \resp{A} and \var{final} = \resp{A}}) \qquad\text{and}\qquad
P(\text{\var{final} = \resp{A}})
\end{eqnarray*}
However, this information is not provided, and it is not obvious how to calculate these probabilities. Since we aren't sure how to proceed, it is useful to organize the information into a tree diagram, as shown in Figure~\ref{testTree}. When constructing a tree diagram, variables provided with marginal probabilities are often used to create the tree's primary branches; in this case, the marginal probabilities are provided for midterm grades. The final grades, which correspond to the conditional probabilities provided, will be shown on the secondary branches.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ch_probability/figures/testTree/testTree}
\caption{A tree diagram describing the \var{midterm} and \var{final} variables.}
\label{testTree}
\end{figure}

With the tree diagram constructed, we may compute the required probabilities:
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&P(\text{\var{midterm} = \resp{A} and \var{final} = \resp{A}}) = 0.0611 \\
&&P(\text{\underline{\color{black}\var{final} = \resp{A}}})  \\
&& \quad= P(\text{\var{midterm} = \resp{other} and \underline{\color{black}\var{final} = \resp{A}}}) + P(\text{\var{midterm} = \resp{A} and \underline{\color{black}\var{final} = \resp{A}}}) \\
&& \quad= 0.0957 + 0.0611  = 0.1568
\end{eqnarray*}
The marginal probability, $P($\var{final} = \resp{A}$)$, was calculated by adding up all the joint probabilities on the right side of the tree that correspond to \var{final} = \resp{A}. We may now finally take the ratio of the two probabilities:
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\text{\var{midterm} = \resp{A}} | \text{\var{final} = \resp{A}}) &=& \frac{P(\text{\var{midterm} = \resp{A} and \var{final} = \resp{A}})}{P(\text{\var{final} = \resp{A}})} \\
&=& \frac{0.0611}{0.1568} = 0.3897
\end{eqnarray*}
The probability the student also earned an A on the midterm is about 0.39.
\end{example}

\subsection{Bayes' Theorem}
\label{bayesTheoremSubsection}

\index{Bayes' Theorem|(}

In many instances, we are given a conditional probability of the form
\begin{align*}
P(\text{statement about variable 1 } | \text{ statement about variable 2})
\end{align*}
but we would really like to know the inverted conditional probability:
\begin{align*}
P(\text{statement about variable 2 } | \text{ statement about variable 1})
\end{align*}
Tree diagrams can be used to find the second conditional probability when given the first. However, sometimes it is not possible to draw the scenario in a tree diagram. In these cases, we can apply a very useful and general formula: Bayes' Theorem.

We first take a critical look at an example of inverting conditional probabilities where we still apply a tree diagram.

\begin{example}{In Canada, about 0.35\% of women over 40 will develop breast cancer in any given year. A common screening test for cancer is the mammogram, but this test is not perfect. In about 11\% of patients with breast cancer, the test gives a \term{false negative}: it indicates a woman does not have breast cancer when she does have breast cancer. Similarly, the test gives a \term{false positive} in 7\% of patients who do not have breast cancer: it indicates these patients have breast cancer when they actually do not.\footnote{The probabilities reported here were obtained using studies reported at \oiRedirect{textbook-breastCancerDotOrg_20090831b}{www.breastcancer.org} and \oiRedirect{textbook-ncbi_nih_breast_cancer}{www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1173421}.} If we tested a random woman over 40 for breast cancer using a mammogram and the test came back positive -- that is, the test suggested the patient has cancer -- what is the probability that the patient actually has breast cancer?} 

\label{probabilityOfBreastCancerGivenPositiveTestExample}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.93\textwidth]{ch_probability/figures/BreastCancerTreeDiagram/BreastCancerTreeDiagram}
\caption{Tree diagram for Example~\ref{probabilityOfBreastCancerGivenPositiveTestExample}, computing the probability a random patient who tests positive on a mammogram actually has breast cancer.}
\label{BreastCancerTreeDiagram}
\end{figure}

Notice that we are given sufficient information to quickly compute the probability of testing positive if a woman has breast cancer ($1.00-0.11=0.89$). However, we seek the inverted probability of cancer given a positive test result. (Watch out for the non-intuitive medical language: a~\emph{positive} test result suggests the possible presence of cancer in a mammogram screening.) This inverted probability may be broken into two pieces:
\begin{align*}
P(\text{has BC } | \text{ mammogram$^+$}) = \frac{P(\text{has BC and mammogram$^+$})}{P(\text{mammogram$^+$})}
\end{align*}
where ``has BC'' is an abbreviation for the patient actually having breast cancer and ``mammogram$^+$'' means the mammogram screening was positive. A tree diagram is useful for identifying each probability and is shown in Figure~\ref{BreastCancerTreeDiagram}. The probability the patient has breast cancer and the mammogram is positive is
\begin{align*}
P(\text{has BC and mammogram$^+$}) &= P(\text{mammogram$^+$ } | \text{ has BC})P(\text{has BC}) \\
	&= 0.89\times 0.0035 = 0.00312
\end{align*}
The probability of a positive test result is the sum of the two corresponding scenarios:
\begin{align*}
P(\text{\underline{\color{black}mammogram$^+$}}) &= P(\text{\underline{\color{black}mammogram$^+$} and has BC}) + P(\text{\underline{\color{black}mammogram$^+$} and no BC}) \\
	&= P(\text{has BC})P(\text{mammogram$^+$ } | \text{ has BC}) \\
	&\qquad\qquad	+ P(\text{no BC})P(\text{mammogram$^+$ } | \text{ no BC}) \\
	&= 0.0035\times 0.89 + 0.9965\times 0.07 = 0.07288
\end{align*}
Then if the mammogram screening is positive for a patient, the probability the patient has breast cancer is
\begin{align*}
P(\text{has BC } | \text{ mammogram$^+$})
	&= \frac{P(\text{has BC and mammogram$^+$})}{P(\text{mammogram$^+$})}\\
	&= \frac{0.00312}{0.07288} \approx 0.0428
\end{align*}
That is, even if a patient has a positive mammogram screening, there is still only a~4\%~chance that she has breast cancer.
\end{example}

Example~\ref{probabilityOfBreastCancerGivenPositiveTestExample} highlights why doctors often run more tests regardless of a first positive test result. When a medical condition is rare, a single positive test isn't generally definitive.

Consider again the last equation of Example~\ref{probabilityOfBreastCancerGivenPositiveTestExample}.
Using the tree diagram, we can see that the numerator (the top of the fraction) is equal to the following product:
\begin{align*}
P(\text{has BC and mammogram$^+$}) = P(\text{mammogram$^+$ } | \text{ has BC})P(\text{has BC})
\end{align*}
The denominator -- the probability the screening was positive -- is equal to the sum of probabilities for each positive screening scenario:
\begin{align*}
P(\text{\underline{\color{black}mammogram$^+$}})
	&= P(\text{\underline{\color{black}mammogram$^+$} and no BC})
		+ P(\text{\underline{\color{black}mammogram$^+$} and has BC})
\end{align*}
In the example, each of the probabilities on the right side was broken down into a product of a conditional probability and marginal probability using the tree diagram.
\begin{align*}
P(\text{mammogram$^+$})
	&= P(\text{mammogram$^+$ and no BC}) + P(\text{mammogram$^+$ and has BC}) \\
	&= P(\text{mammogram$^+$ } | \text{ no BC})P(\text{no BC}) \\
			   &\qquad\qquad + P(\text{mammogram$^+$ } | \text{ has BC})P(\text{has BC})
\end{align*}
We can see an application of Bayes' Theorem by substituting the resulting probability expressions into the numerator and denominator of the original conditional probability.
\begin{align*}
& P(\text{has BC } | \text{ mammogram$^+$})  \\
& \qquad= \frac{P(\text{mammogram$^+$ } | \text{ has BC})P(\text{has BC})}
	{P(\text{mammogram$^+$ } | \text{ no BC})P(\text{no BC}) + P(\text{mammogram$^+$ } | \text{ has BC})P(\text{has BC})}
\end{align*}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Bayes' Theorem: inverting probabilities}
Consider the following conditional probability for variable 1 and variable 2:\vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{align*}
P(\text{outcome $A_1$ of variable 1 } | \text{ outcome $B$ of variable 2})
\end{align*}
Bayes' Theorem states that this conditional probability can be identified as the following fraction:\vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{align}
\frac{P(B | A_1) P(A_1)}
	{P(B | A_1) P(A_1) + P(B | A_2) P(A_2) + \cdots + P(B | A_k) P(A_k)}
	\label{equationOfBayesTheorem}
\end{align}
where $A_2$, $A_3$, ..., and $A_k$ represent all other possible outcomes of the first variable.}\index{Bayes' Theorem|textbf}
\end{termBox}

Bayes' Theorem is just a generalization of what we have done using tree diagrams. The numerator identifies the probability of getting both $A_1$ and $B$. The denominator is the marginal probability of getting $B$. This bottom component of the fraction appears long and complicated since we have to add up probabilities from all of the different ways to get $B$. We always completed this step when using tree diagrams. However, we usually did it in a separate step so it didn't seem as complex.

To apply Bayes' Theorem correctly, there are two preparatory steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[(1)] First identify the marginal probabilities of each possible outcome of the first variable: $P(A_1)$, $P(A_2)$, ..., $P(A_k)$.
\item[(2)] Then identify the probability of the outcome $B$, conditioned on each possible scenario for the first variable: $P(B | A_1)$, $P(B | A_2)$, ..., $P(B | A_k)$.
\end{enumerate}
Once each of these probabilities are identified, they can be applied directly within the formula.

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Only use Bayes' Theorem when tree diagrams are difficult}
Drawing a tree diagram makes it easier to understand how two variables are connected. Use Bayes' Theorem only when there are so many scenarios that drawing a tree diagram would be complex.}

\textC{\newpage}

\begin{exercise} \label{exerciseForParkingLotOnCampusBeingFullAndWhetherOrNotThereIsASportingEvent}
Jose visits campus every Thursday evening. However, some days the parking garage is full, often due to college events. There are academic events on 35\% of evenings, sporting events on 20\% of evenings, and no events on 45\% of evenings. When there is an academic event, the garage fills up about 25\% of the time, and it fills up 70\% of evenings with sporting events. On evenings when there are no events, it only fills up about 5\% of the time. If Jose comes to campus and finds the garage full, what is the probability that there is a sporting event? Use a tree diagram to solve this problem.\footnote{\begin{minipage}[t]{0.47\linewidth}
The tree diagram, with three primary branches, is shown to the right. Next, we identify two probabilities from the tree diagram. (1) The probability that there is a sporting event and the garage is full: 0.14. (2) The probability the garage is full: $0.0875 + 0.14 + 0.0225 = 0.25$. Then the solution is the ratio of these probabilities: $\frac{0.14}{0.25} = 0.56$. If the garage is full, there is a 56\% probability that there is a sporting event. \vspace{0.1mm} \\\ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.5\linewidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_probability/figures/treeDiagramGarage/treeDiagramGarage}\vspace{-30mm}
\end{minipage}}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{Here we solve the same problem presented in Guided Practice~\ref{exerciseForParkingLotOnCampusBeingFullAndWhetherOrNotThereIsASportingEvent}, except this time we use Bayes' Theorem.}
The outcome of interest is whether there is a sporting event (call this $A_1$), and the condition is that the lot is full ($B$). Let $A_2$ represent an academic event and $A_3$ represent there being no event on campus. Then the given probabilities can be written as
\begin{align*}
&P(A_1) = 0.2 &&P(A_2) = 0.35 &&P(A_3) = 0.45 \\
&P(B | A_1) = 0.7 &&P(B | A_2) = 0.25 &&P(B | A_3) = 0.05
\end{align*}
Bayes' Theorem can be used to compute the probability of a sporting event ($A_1$) under the condition that the parking lot is full ($B$):
\begin{align*}
P(A_1 | B) &= \frac{P(B | A_1) P(A_1)}{P(B | A_1) P(A_1) + P(B | A_2) P(A_2) + P(B | A_3) P(A_3)} \\
		&= \frac{(0.7)(0.2)}{(0.7)(0.2) + (0.25)(0.35) + (0.05)(0.45)} \\
		&= 0.56 
\end{align*}
Based on the information that the garage is full, there is a 56\% probability that a sporting event is being held on campus that evening.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise} \label{exerciseForParkingLotOnCampusBeingFullAndWhetherOrNotThereIsAnAcademicEvent}
Use the information in the previous exercise and example to verify the probability that there is an academic event conditioned on the parking lot being full is 0.35.\footnote{Short answer:
\begin{align*}
P(A_2 | B) &= \frac{P(B | A_2) P(A_2)}{P(B | A_1) P(A_1) + P(B | A_2) P(A_2) + P(B | A_3) P(A_3)} \\
		&= \frac{(0.25)(0.35)}{(0.7)(0.2) + (0.25)(0.35) + (0.05)(0.45)} \\
		&= 0.35
\end{align*}}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{exerciseForParkingLotOnCampusBeingFullAndWhetherOrNotThereIsNoEvent}
In Guided Practice~\ref{exerciseForParkingLotOnCampusBeingFullAndWhetherOrNotThereIsASportingEvent} and~\ref{exerciseForParkingLotOnCampusBeingFullAndWhetherOrNotThereIsAnAcademicEvent}, you found that if the parking lot is full, the probability there is a sporting event is 0.56 and the probability there is an academic event is 0.35. Using this information, compute $P($no event $|$ the lot is full$)$.\footnote{Each probability is conditioned on the same information that the garage is full, so the complement may be used: $1.00 - 0.56 - 0.35 = 0.09$.}
\end{exercise}

The last several exercises offered a way to update our belief about whether there is a sporting event, academic event, or no event going on at the school based on the information that the parking lot was full. This strategy of \emph{updating beliefs} using Bayes' Theorem is actually the foundation of an entire section of statistics called \term{Bayesian statistics}. While Bayesian statistics is very important and useful, we will not have time to cover much more of it in this book.

\section{Sampling from a small population (special topic)}
\label{smallPop}

\begin{example}{Professors sometimes select a student at random to answer a question. If each student has an equal chance of being selected and there are 15 people in your class, what is the chance that she will pick you for the next question?}
If there are 15 people to ask and none are skipping class, then the probability is $1/15$, or about $0.067$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{If the professor asks 3 questions, what is the probability that you will not be selected? Assume that she will not pick the same person twice in a given lecture.}\label{3woRep}
For the first question, she will pick someone else with probability $14/15$. When she asks the second question, she only has 14 people who have not yet been asked. Thus, if you were not picked on the first question, the probability you are again not picked is $13/14$. Similarly, the probability you are again not picked on the third question is $12/13$, and the probability of not being picked for any of the three questions is
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&P(\text{not picked in 3 questions}) \\
&&\quad = P(\text{\var{Q1}} = \text{\resp{not\_\hspace{0.3mm}picked}, }\text{\var{Q2}} = \text{\resp{not\_\hspace{0.3mm}picked}, }\text{\var{Q3}} = \text{\resp{not\_\hspace{0.3mm}picked}.}) \\
&&\quad = \frac{14}{15}\times\frac{13}{14}\times\frac{12}{13} = \frac{12}{15} = 0.80
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
What rule permitted us to multiply the probabilities in Example~\ref{3woRep}?\footnote{The three probabilities we computed were actually one marginal probability, $P($\var{Q1}$ = $\resp{not\_\hspace{0.3mm}picked}$)$, and two conditional probabilities:
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&P(\text{\var{Q2}} =  \text{\resp{not\_\hspace{0.3mm}picked} }|\text{ \var{Q1}} = \text{\resp{not\_\hspace{0.3mm}picked}}) \\
&&P(\text{\var{Q3}} =  \text{\resp{not\_\hspace{0.3mm}picked} }|\text{ \var{Q1}} = \text{\resp{not\_\hspace{0.3mm}picked}, }\text{\var{Q2}} = \text{\resp{not\_\hspace{0.3mm}picked}})
\end{eqnarray*}
Using the General Multiplication Rule, the product of these three probabilities is the probability of not being picked in 3 questions.}
\end{exercise}

\textC{\newpage}

\begin{example}{Suppose the professor randomly picks without regard to who she already selected, i.e. students can be picked more than once. What is the probability that you will not be picked for any of the three questions?}\label{3wRep}
Each pick is independent, and the probability of not being picked for any individual question is $14/15$. Thus, we can use the Multiplication Rule for independent processes.
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&P(\text{not picked in 3 questions}) \\
&&\quad = P(\text{\var{Q1}} = \text{\resp{not\_\hspace{0.3mm}picked}, }\text{\var{Q2}} = \text{\resp{not\_\hspace{0.3mm}picked}, }\text{\var{Q3}} = \text{\resp{not\_\hspace{0.3mm}picked}.}) \\
&&\quad = \frac{14}{15}\times\frac{14}{15}\times\frac{14}{15} = 0.813
\end{eqnarray*}
You have a slightly higher chance of not being picked compared to when she picked a new person for each question. However, you now may be picked more than once.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Under the setup of Example~\ref{3wRep}, what is the probability of being picked to answer all three questions?\footnote{$P($being picked to answer all three questions$) = \left(\frac{1}{15}\right)^3 = 0.00030$.}
\end{exercise}

If we sample from a small population \term{without replacement}, we no longer have independence between our observations. In Example~\ref{3woRep}, the probability of not being picked for the second question was conditioned on the event that you were not picked for the first question. In Example~\ref{3wRep}, the professor sampled her students \term{with replacement}: she repeatedly sampled the entire class without regard to who she already picked. 

\begin{exercise} \label{raffleOf30TicketsWWOReplacement}
Your department is holding a raffle. They sell 30 tickets and offer seven prizes. (a) They place the tickets in a hat and draw one for each prize. The tickets are sampled without replacement, i.e. the selected tickets are not placed back in the hat. What is the probability of winning a prize if you buy one ticket? (b)~What if the tickets are sampled with replacement?\footnote{(a) First determine the probability of not winning. The tickets are sampled without replacement, which means the probability you do not win on the first draw is $29/30$, $28/29$ for the second, ..., and $23/24$ for the seventh. The probability you win no prize is the product of these separate probabilities: $23/30$. That is, the probability of winning a prize is $1 - 23/30 = 7/30 = 0.233$. (b)~When the tickets are sampled with replacement, there are seven independent draws. Again we first find the probability of not winning a prize: $(29/30)^7 = 0.789$. Thus, the probability of winning (at least) one prize when drawing with replacement is 0.211.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{followUpToRaffleOf30TicketsWWOReplacement}
Compare your answers in Guided Practice~\ref{raffleOf30TicketsWWOReplacement}. How much influence does the sampling method have on your chances of winning a prize?\footnote{There is about a 10\% larger chance of winning a prize when using sampling without replacement. However, at most one prize may be won under this sampling procedure.}
\end{exercise}

Had we repeated Guided Practice~\ref{raffleOf30TicketsWWOReplacement} with 300 tickets instead of 30, we would have found something interesting: the results would be nearly identical. The probability would be 0.0233 without replacement and 0.0231 with replacement. When the sample size is only a small fraction of the population (under 10\%), observations are nearly independent even when sampling without replacement.

\section{Random variables (special topic)}
\label{randomVariablesSection}

\index{random variable|(}

\begin{example}{Two books are assigned for a statistics class: a textbook and its corresponding study guide. The university bookstore determined 20\% of enrolled students do not buy either book, 55\% buy the textbook only, and 25\% buy both books, and these percentages are relatively constant from one term to another. If~there are 100 students enrolled, how many books should the bookstore expect to sell to this class?}\label{bookStoreSales}
Around 20 students will not buy either book (0 books total), about 55 will buy one book (55 books total), and approximately 25 will buy two books (totaling 50 books for these 25 students). The bookstore should expect to sell about 105 books for this class.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Would you be surprised if the bookstore sold slightly more or less than 105 books?\footnote{If they sell a little more or a little less, this should not be a surprise. Hopefully Chapter~\ref{introductionToData} helped make clear that there is natural variability in observed data. For example, if we would flip a coin 100 times, it will not usually come up heads exactly half the time, but it will probably be close.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{The textbook costs \$137 and the study guide \$33. How much revenue should the bookstore expect from this class of 100 students?}\label{bookStoreRev}
About 55 students will just buy a textbook, providing revenue of
\begin{eqnarray*}
\$137 \times  55 = \$7,535
\end{eqnarray*}
The roughly 25 students who buy both the textbook and the study guide would pay a total of
\begin{eqnarray*}
(\$137 + \$33) \times  25 = \$170 \times  25 = \$4,250
\end{eqnarray*}
Thus, the bookstore should expect to generate about $\$7,535 + \$4,250 = \$11,785$ from these 100 students for this one class. However, there might be some \emph{sampling variability} so the actual amount may differ by a little bit.
\end{example}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{ch_probability/figures/bookCostDist/bookCostDist}
\caption{Probability distribution for the bookstore's revenue from a single student. The distribution balances on a triangle representing the average revenue per student.}
\label{bookCostDist}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}{What is the average revenue per student for this course?}\label{revFromStudent}
The expected total revenue is \$11,785, and there are 100 students. Therefore the expected revenue per student is $\$11,785/100 =  \$117.85$.
\end{example}

\subsection{Expectation}

\index{expectation|(}

We call a variable or process with a numerical outcome a \term{random variable}, and we usually represent this random variable with a capital letter such as $X$, $Y$, or $Z$. The amount of money a single student will spend on her statistics books is a random variable, and we represent it by $X$.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Random variable}
A random process or variable with a numerical outcome.}
\end{termBox}

The possible outcomes of $X$ are labeled with a corresponding lower case letter $x$ and subscripts. For example, we write $x_1=\$0$, $x_2=\$137$, and $x_3=\$170$, which occur with probabilities $0.20$, $0.55$, and $0.25$. The distribution of $X$ is summarized in Figure~\ref{bookCostDist} and Table~\ref{statSpendDist}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l ccc r}
\hline
$i$	  & 1 & 2 & 3  & Total\\
\hline
$x_i$ & \$0 & \$137 & \$170 & --\\
$P(X=x_i)$ & 0.20 & 0.55 & 0.25 & 1.00 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{The probability distribution for the random variable $X$, representing the bookstore's revenue from a single student.}
\label{statSpendDist}
\end{table}

We computed the average outcome of $X$ as \$117.85 in Example~\ref{revFromStudent}. We call this average the \term{expected value} of $X$, denoted by $E(X)$\index{EX@$E(X)$}\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-3mm}

$E(X)$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Expected\\value of $X$]{\raggedright\vspace{-3mm}

$E(X)$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Expected\\value of $X$}. The expected value of a random variable is computed by adding each outcome weighted by its probability:
\begin{align*}
E(X) &= 0 \times  P(X=0) + 137 \times  P(X=137) + 170 \times  P(X=170) \\
	&= 0 \times  0.20 + 137 \times  0.55 + 170 \times  0.25 = 117.85
\end{align*}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Expected value of a Discrete Random Variable}
If $X$ takes outcomes $x_1$, ..., $x_k$ with probabilities $P(X=x_1)$, ..., $P(X=x_k)$, the expected value of $X$ is the sum of each outcome multiplied by its corresponding probability:
\begin{align}
E(X) 	&= x_1\times P(X=x_1) + \cdots + x_k\times P(X=x_k) \notag \\
	&= \sum_{i=1}^{k}x_iP(X=x_i)
\end{align}
The Greek letter $\mu$\index{Greek!mu ($\mu$)} may be used in place of the notation $E(X)$.}
\end{termBox}

The expected value for a random variable represents the average outcome. For example, $E(X)=117.85$ represents the average amount the bookstore expects to make from a single student, which we could also write as $\mu=117.85$.

It is also possible to compute the expected value of a continuous random variable (see Section~\ref{contDist}). However, it requires a little calculus and we save it for a later class.\footnote{$\mu = \int xf(x)dx$ where $f(x)$ represents a function for the density curve.}

In physics, the expectation holds the same meaning as the center of gravity. The distribution can be represented by a series of weights at each outcome, and the mean represents the balancing point. This is represented in Figures~\ref{bookCostDist} and~\ref{bookWts}. The idea of a center of gravity also expands to continuous probability distributions. Figure~\ref{contBalance} shows a continuous probability distribution balanced atop a wedge placed at the mean.

\subsection{Variability in random variables}

Suppose you ran the university bookstore. Besides how much revenue you expect to generate, you might also want to know the volatility (variability) in your revenue. 

The \indexthis{variance}{variance} and \indexthis{standard deviation}{standard deviation} can be used to describe the variability of a random variable. Section~\ref{variability}
introduced a method for finding the variance and standard deviation for a data set. We first computed deviations from the mean ($x_i - \mu$), squared those deviations, and took an average to get the variance. In the case of a random variable, we again compute squared deviations. However, we take their sum weighted by their corresponding probabilities, just like we did for the expectation. This weighted sum of squared deviations equals the variance, and we calculate the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance, just as we did in Section~\ref{variability}.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{General variance formula}
If $X$ takes outcomes $x_1$, ..., $x_k$ with probabilities $P(X=x_1)$, ..., $P(X=x_k)$ and expected value $\mu=E(X)$, then the variance of $X$, denoted by $Var(X)$ or the symbol $\sigma^2$, is
\begin{align}
\sigma^2 &= (x_1-\mu)^2\times P(X=x_1) + \cdots \notag \\
	& \qquad\quad\cdots+ (x_k-\mu)^2\times P(X=x_k) \notag \\
	&= \sum_{j=1}^{k} (x_j - \mu)^2 P(X=x_j)
\end{align}
The standard deviation of $X$, labeled $\sigma$\index{Greek!sigma ($\sigma$)}, is the square root of the variance.}
\end{termBox}
\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-47mm}

$Var(X)$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Variance\\of $X$]{\raggedright\vspace{-47mm}

$Var(X)$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Variance\\of $X$}

\begin{example}{Compute the expected value, variance, and standard deviation of $X$, the revenue of a single statistics student for the bookstore.}
It is useful to construct a table that holds computations for each outcome separately, then add up the results.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l rrr r}
\hline
$i$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & Total \\
\hline
$x_i$ & \$0 & \$137 & \$170 &  \\
$P(X=x_i)$ & 0.20 & 0.55 & 0.25 &  \\
$x_i \times  P(X=x_i)$ & 0 & 75.35 & 42.50 & 117.85 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Thus, the expected value is $\mu=117.85$, which we computed earlier. The variance can be constructed by extending this table:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l rrr r}
\hline
$i$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & Total \\
\hline
$x_i$ & \$0 & \$137 & \$170 &  \\
$P(X=x_i)$ & 0.20 & 0.55 & 0.25 &  \\
$x_i \times  P(X=x_i)$ & 0 & 75.35 & 42.50 & 117.85 \\
$x_i - \mu$ & -117.85 & 19.15 & 52.15 &  \\
$(x_i-\mu)^2$ & 13888.62 &  366.72 & 2719.62 &  \\
$(x_i-\mu)^2\times P(X=x_i)$ & 2777.7 & 201.7 & 679.9 & 3659.3 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The variance of $X$ is $\sigma^2 = 3659.3$, which means the standard deviation is $\sigma = \sqrt{3659.3} = \$60.49$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
The bookstore also offers a chemistry textbook for \$159 and a book supplement for \$41.

\subsection{Linear combinations of random variables}

So far, we have thought of each variable as being a complete story in and of itself. Sometimes it is more appropriate to use a combination of variables. For instance, the amount of time a person spends commuting to work each week can be broken down into several daily commutes. Similarly, the total gain or loss in a stock portfolio is the sum of the gains and losses in its components.

\begin{example}{John travels to work five days a week. We will use $X_1$ to represent his travel time on Monday, $X_2$ to represent his travel time on Tuesday, and so on. Write an equation using $X_1$, ..., $X_5$ that represents his travel time for the week, denoted by $W$.}
His total weekly travel time is the sum of the five daily values:
$$ W = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5 $$
Breaking the weekly travel time $W$ into pieces provides a framework for understanding each source of randomness and is useful for modeling $W$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{It takes John an average of 18 minutes each day to commute to work. What would you expect his average commute time to be for the week?}
We were told that the average (i.e. expected value) of the commute time is 18 minutes per day: $E(X_i) = 18$. To get the expected time for the sum of the five days, we can add up the expected time for each individual day:
\begin{align*}
E(W) &= E(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5) \\
	&= E(X_1) + E(X_2) + E(X_3) + E(X_4) + E(X_5) \\
	&= 18 + 18 + 18 + 18 + 18 = 90\text{ minutes}
\end{align*}
The expectation of the total time is equal to the sum of the expected individual times. More generally, the expectation of a sum of random variables is always the sum of the expectation for each random variable.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise} \label{elenaIsSellingATVAndBuyingAToasterOvenAtAnAuction}
Elena is selling a TV at a cash auction and also intends to buy a toaster oven in the auction. If $X$ represents the profit for selling the TV and $Y$ represents the cost of the toaster oven, write an equation that represents the net change in Elena's cash.\footnote{She will make $X$ dollars on the TV but spend $Y$ dollars on the toaster oven: $X-Y$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Based on past auctions, Elena figures she should expect to make about \$175 on the TV and pay about \$23 for the toaster oven. In total, how much should she expect to make or spend?\footnote{$E(X-Y) = E(X) - E(Y) = 175 - 23 = \$152$. She should expect to make about \$152.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{explainWhyThereIsUncertaintyInTheSum}
Would you be surprised if John's weekly commute wasn't exactly 90 minutes or if Elena didn't make exactly \$152? Explain.\footnote{No, since there is probably some variability. For example, the traffic will vary from one day to next, and auction prices will vary depending on the quality of the merchandise and the interest of the attendees.}
\end{exercise}

Two important concepts concerning combinations of random variables have so far been introduced. First, a final value can sometimes be described as the sum of its parts in an equation. Second, intuition suggests that putting the individual average values into this equation gives the average value we would expect in total. This second point needs clarification -- it is guaranteed to be true in what are called \emph{linear combinations of random variables}.

A \term{linear combination} of two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is a fancy phrase to describe a combination
$$ aX + bY$$
where $a$ and $b$ are some fixed and known numbers. For John's commute time, there were five random variables -- one for each work day -- and each random variable could be written as having a fixed coefficient of 1:
$$ 1X_1 + 1 X_2 + 1 X_3 + 1 X_4 + 1 X_5 $$
For Elena's net gain or loss, the $X$ random variable had a coefficient of +1 and the $Y$ random variable had a coefficient of -1.

When considering the average of a linear combination of random variables, it is safe to plug in the mean of each random variable and then compute the final result. For a few examples of nonlinear combinations of random variables -- cases where we cannot simply plug in the means -- see the footnote.\footnote{If $X$ and $Y$ are random variables, consider the following combinations: $X^{1+Y}$, $X\times Y$, $X/Y$. In such cases, plugging in the average value for each random variable and computing the result will not generally lead to an accurate average value for the end result.}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Linear combinations of random variables and the average result}
If $X$ and $Y$ are random variables, then a linear combination of the random variables is given by
\begin{align}\label{linComboOfRandomVariablesXAndY}
aX + bY
\end{align}
where $a$ and $b$ are some fixed numbers. To compute the average value of a linear combination of random variables, plug in the average of each individual random variable and compute the result:
\begin{align*}
a\times E(X) + b\times E(Y)
\end{align*}
Recall that the expected value is the same as the mean, e.g. $E(X) = \mu_X$.}
\end{termBox}

\begin{example}{Leonard has invested \$6000 in Google Inc. (stock ticker: GOOG) and \$2000 in Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM). If $X$ represents the change in Google's stock next month and $Y$ represents the change in Exxon Mobil stock next month, write an equation that describes how much money will be made or lost in Leonard's stocks for the month.}
For simplicity, we will suppose $X$ and $Y$ are not in percents but are in decimal form (e.g. if Google's stock increases 1\%, then $X=0.01$; or if it loses 1\%, then $X=-0.01$). Then we can write an equation for Leonard's gain as
\begin{align*}
\$6000\times X + \$2000\times Y
\end{align*}
If we plug in the change in the stock value for $X$ and $Y$, this equation gives the change in value of Leonard's stock portfolio for the month. A positive value represents a gain, and a negative value represents a loss.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}\label{expectedChangeInLeonardsStockPortfolio}
Suppose Google and Exxon Mobil stocks have recently been rising 2.1\% and 0.4\% per month, respectively. Compute the expected change in Leonard's stock portfolio for next month.\footnote{$E(\$6000\times X + \$2000\times Y) = \$6000\times 0.021 + \$2000\times 0.004 = \$134$.}
% library(stockPortfolio); gr <- getReturns(c("GOOG", "XOM"), start="2006-01-01"); gr
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
You should have found that Leonard expects a positive gain in Guided Practice~\ref{expectedChangeInLeonardsStockPortfolio}. However, would you be surprised if he actually had a loss this month?\footnote{No. While stocks tend to rise over time, they are often volatile in the short term.}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Variability in linear combinations of random variables}

Quantifying the average outcome from a linear combination of random variables is helpful, but it is also important to have some sense of the uncertainty associated with the total outcome of that combination of random variables. The expected net gain or loss of Leonard's stock portfolio was considered in Guided Practice~\ref{expectedChangeInLeonardsStockPortfolio}. However, there was no quantitative discussion of the volatility of this portfolio. For instance, while the average monthly gain might be about \$134 according to the data, that gain is not guaranteed. Figure~\ref{changeInLeonardsStockPortfolioFor36Months} shows the monthly changes in a portfolio like Leonard's during the 36 months from 2009 to 2011. The gains and losses vary widely, and quantifying these fluctuations is important when investing in stocks.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{ch_probability/figures/changeInLeonardsStockPortfolioFor36Months/changeInLeonardsStockPortfolioFor36Months}
\caption{The change in a portfolio like Leonard's for the 36 months from 2009 to 2011, where \$6000 is in Google's stock and \$2000 is in Exxon Mobil's.}
\label{changeInLeonardsStockPortfolioFor36Months}
\end{figure}

Just as we have done in many previous cases, we use the variance and standard deviation to describe the uncertainty associated with Leonard's monthly returns. To do so, the variances of each stock's monthly return will be useful, and these are shown in Table~\ref{sumStatOfGOOGXOM}. The stocks' returns are nearly independent.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\hline
	& Mean ($\bar{x}$) & Standard deviation ($s$) & Variance ($s^2$) \\
\hline
GOOG & 0.0210	& 0.0846					&	0.0072	\\
XOM & 0.0038		& 0.0519					&	0.0027	\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{The mean, standard deviation, and variance of the GOOG and XOM stocks. These statistics were estimated from historical stock data, so notation used for sample statistics has been used.}
\label{sumStatOfGOOGXOM}
\end{table}

Here we use an equation from probability theory to describe the uncertainty of Leonard's monthly returns; we leave the proof of this method to a dedicated probability course. The variance of a linear combination of random variables can be computed by plugging in the variances of the individual random variables and squaring the coefficients of the random variables:
\begin{align*}
Var(aX + bY) = a^2\times Var(X) + b^2\times Var(Y)
\end{align*}
It is important to note that this equality assumes the random variables are independent; if independence doesn't hold, then more advanced methods are necessary. This equation can be used to compute the variance of Leonard's monthly return:
\begin{align*}
Var(6000\times X + 2000\times Y)
	&= 6000^2\times Var(X) + 2000^2\times Var(Y) \\
	&= 36,000,000\times 0.0072 + 4,000,000\times 0.0027 \\
	&= 270,000
\end{align*}
The standard deviation is computed as the square root of the variance: $\sqrt{270,000} = \$520$. While an average monthly return of \$134 on an \$8000 investment is nothing to scoff at, the monthly returns are so volatile that Leonard should not expect this income to be very stable.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Variability of linear combinations of random variables}
The variance of a linear combination of random variables may be computed by squaring the constants, substituting in the variances for the random variables, and computing the result:
\begin{align*}
Var(aX + bY) = a^2\times Var(X) + b^2\times Var(Y)
\end{align*}
This equation is valid as long as the random variables are independent of each other. The standard deviation of the linear combination may be found by taking the square root of the variance.}
\end{termBox}

\begin{example}{Suppose John's daily commute has a standard deviation of 4 minutes. What is the uncertainty in his total commute time for the week?} \label{sdOfJohnsCommuteWeeklyTime}
The expression for John's commute time was
\begin{align*}
X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5
\end{align*}
Each coefficient is 1, and the variance of each day's time is $4^2=16$. Thus, the variance of the total weekly commute time is
\begin{align*}
&\text{variance }= 1^2 \times  16 + 1^2 \times  16 + 1^2 \times  16 + 1^2 \times  16 + 1^2 \times  16 = 5\times 16 = 80 \\
&\text{standard deviation } = \sqrt{\text{variance}} = \sqrt{80} = 8.94
\end{align*}
The standard deviation for John's weekly work commute time is about 9 minutes.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
The computation in Example~\ref{sdOfJohnsCommuteWeeklyTime} relied on an important assumption: the commute time for each day is independent of the time on other days of that week. Do you think this is valid? Explain.\footnote{One concern is whether traffic patterns tend to have a weekly cycle (e.g. Fridays may be worse than other days). If that is the case, and John drives, then the assumption is probably not reasonable. However, if John walks to work, then his commute is probably not affected by any weekly traffic cycle.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{elenaIsSellingATVAndBuyingAToasterOvenAtAnAuctionVariability}
Consider Elena's two auctions from Guided Practice~\ref{elenaIsSellingATVAndBuyingAToasterOvenAtAnAuction} on page~\pageref{elenaIsSellingATVAndBuyingAToasterOvenAtAnAuction}. Suppose these auctions are approximately independent and the variability in auction prices associated with the TV and toaster oven can be described using standard deviations of \$25 and \$8. Compute the standard deviation of Elena's net gain.\footnote{The equation for Elena can be written as
\begin{align*}
(1)\times X + (-1)\times Y
\end{align*}
The variances of $X$ and $Y$ are 625 and 64. We square the coefficients and plug in the variances:
\begin{align*}
(1)^2\times Var(X) + (-1)^2\times Var(Y) = 1\times 625 + 1\times 64 = 689
\end{align*}
The variance of the linear combination is 689, and the standard deviation is the square root of 689: about \$26.25.}
\end{exercise}

Consider again Guided Practice~\ref{elenaIsSellingATVAndBuyingAToasterOvenAtAnAuctionVariability}. The negative coefficient for $Y$ in the linear combination was eliminated when we squared the coefficients. This generally holds true: negatives in a linear combination will have no impact on the variability computed for a linear combination, but they do impact the expected value computations.

\section{Continuous distributions (special topic)}
\label{contDist}

\index{data!FCID|(}
\index{hollow histogram|(}
\begin{example}{Figure~\ref{fdicHistograms} shows a few different hollow histograms of the variable \var{height} for 3 million US adults from the mid-90's.\footnote{This sample can be considered a simple random sample from the US population. It relies on the USDA Food Commodity Intake Database.} How does changing the number of bins allow you to make different interpretations of the data?}\label{usHeights}
Adding more bins provides greater detail. This sample is extremely large, which is why much smaller bins still work well. Usually we do not use so many bins with smaller sample sizes since small counts per bin mean the bin heights are very volatile.
\end{example}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ch_probability/figures/fdicHistograms/fdicHistograms}
\caption{Four hollow histograms of US adults heights with varying bin widths.}
\label{fdicHistograms}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}{What proportion of the sample is between \resp{180} cm and \resp{185} cm tall (about 5'11" to 6'1")?}\label{contDistProb}
We can add up the heights of the bins in the range \resp{180} cm and \resp{185} and divide by the sample size. For instance, this can be done with the two shaded bins shown in Figure~\ref{usHeightsHist180185}. The two bins in this region have counts of 195,307 and 156,239 people, resulting in the following estimate of the probability:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{195307+156239}{\text{3,000,000}} = 0.1172
\end{eqnarray*}
This fraction is the same as the proportion of the histogram's area that falls in the range \resp{180} to \resp{185} cm.
\end{example}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ch_probability/figures/usHeightsHist180185/usHeightsHist180185}
\caption{A histogram with bin sizes of 2.5 cm. The shaded region represents individuals with heights between \resp{180} and \resp{185} cm. }
\label{usHeightsHist180185}
\end{figure}

\subsection{From histograms to continuous distributions}

Examine the transition from a boxy hollow histogram in the top-left of Figure~\ref{fdicHistograms} to the much smoother plot in the lower-right. In this last plot, the bins are so slim that the hollow histogram is starting to resemble a smooth curve. This suggests the population height as a \emph{continuous} numerical variable might best be explained by a curve that represents the outline of extremely slim bins.

This smooth curve represents a \term{probability density function} (also called a \term{density} or \term{distribution}), and such a curve is shown in Figure~\ref{fdicHeightContDist} overlaid on a histogram of the sample. A density has a special property: the total area under the density's curve is 1. 

\begin{figure}[tbh]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ch_probability/figures/fdicHeightContDist/fdicHeightContDist}
\caption{The continuous probability distribution of heights for US adults.}
\label{fdicHeightContDist}
\end{figure}

\index{hollow histogram|)}

\subsection{Probabilities from continuous distributions}

We computed the proportion of individuals with heights \resp{180} to \resp{185} cm in Example~\ref{contDistProb} as a fraction:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\text{number of people between \resp{180} and \resp{185}}}{\text{total sample size}}
\end{eqnarray*}
We found the number of people with heights between \resp{180} and \resp{185} cm by determining the fraction of the histogram's area in this region. Similarly, we can use the area in the shaded region under the curve to find a probability (with the help of a computer):
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\text{\var{height} between \resp{180} and \resp{185}})
	= \text{area between \resp{180} and \resp{185}}
	= 0.1157
\end{eqnarray*}
The probability that a randomly selected person is between \resp{180} and \resp{185} cm is 0.1157. This is very close to the estimate from Example~\ref{contDistProb}: 0.1172. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ch_probability/figures/fdicHeightContDistFilled/fdicHeightContDistFilled}
\caption{Density for heights in the US adult population with the area between 180 and 185 cm shaded. Compare this plot with Figure~\ref{usHeightsHist180185}.}
\label{fdicHeightContDistFilled}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
Three US adults are randomly selected. The probability a single adult is between \resp{180} and \resp{185} cm is 0.1157.\footnote{Brief answers: (a) $0.1157 \times 0.1157 \times 0.1157 = 0.0015$. (b) $(1-0.1157)^3 = 0.692$} \vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[(a)] What is the probability that all three are between \resp{180} and \resp{185} cm tall?
\item[(b)] What is the probability that none are between \resp{180} and \resp{185} cm?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{What is the probability that a randomly selected person is \textbf{exactly} \resp{180}~cm? Assume you can measure perfectly.}
\label{probabilityOfExactly180cm}
This probability is zero. A person might be close to \resp{180} cm, but not exactly \resp{180} cm tall. This also makes sense with the definition of probability as area; there is no area captured between \resp{180}~cm and \resp{180}~cm.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Suppose a person's height is rounded to the nearest centimeter. Is there a chance that a random person's \textbf{measured} height will be \resp{180} cm?\footnote{This has positive probability. Anyone between \resp{179.5} cm and \resp{180.5} cm will have a \emph{measured} height of \resp{180} cm. This is probably a more realistic scenario to encounter in practice versus Example~\ref{probabilityOfExactly180cm}.}

\section{Normal distribution}
\label{normalDist}

Among all the distributions we see in practice, one is overwhelmingly the most common. The symmetric, unimodal, bell curve is ubiquitous throughout statistics. Indeed it is so common, that people often know it as the \term{normal curve} or \termsub{normal distribution}{distribution!normal},\footnote{It is also introduced as the Gaussian distribution after Frederic Gauss, the first person to formalize its mathematical expression.} shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stdNormal}. Variables such as SAT scores and heights of US adult males closely follow the normal distribution.

\caption[Standard normal distribution]{Standard normal distribution}\label{fig:stdNormal}
\end{figure}


\end{knitrout}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Normal distribution facts}
Many variables are nearly normal, but none are exactly normal. Thus the normal distribution, while not perfect for any single problem, is very useful for a variety of problems. We will use it in data exploration and to solve important problems in statistics.\vspace{0.7mm}}
\end{termBox}


\subsection{Normal distribution model}

The normal distribution model always describes a symmetric, unimodal, bell-shaped curve. However, these curves can look different depending on the details of the model. Specifically, the normal distribution model can be adjusted using two parameters: mean and standard deviation. As you can probably guess, changing the mean shifts the bell curve to the left or right, while changing the standard deviation stretches or constricts the curve. Figure~\ref{twoSampleNormals} shows the normal distribution with mean $0$ and standard deviation $1$ in the left panel and the normal distributions with mean $19$ and standard deviation $4$ in the right panel. Figure~\ref{twoSampleNormalsStacked} shows these distributions on the same axis.

\begin{figure}[hht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/twoSampleNormals/twoSampleNormals}
\caption{Both curves represent the normal distribution, however, they differ in their center and spread. The normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 is called the \term{standard normal distribution}.}
\label{twoSampleNormals}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[hht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/twoSampleNormalsStacked/twoSampleNormalsStacked}
\caption{The normal models shown in Figure~\ref{twoSampleNormals} but plotted together and on the same scale.}
\label{twoSampleNormalsStacked}
\end{figure}

If a normal distribution has mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, we may write the distribution as $N(\mu, \sigma)$\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-5mm}

$N(\mu, \sigma)$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Normal dist.\\with mean $\mu$\\\& st. dev. $\sigma$]{\raggedright\vspace{-5mm}

$N(\mu, \sigma)$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Normal dist.\\with mean $\mu$\\\& st. dev. $\sigma$}. The two distributions in Figure~\ref{twoSampleNormalsStacked} can be written as
\begin{align*}
N(\mu=0,\sigma=1)\quad\text{and}\quad N(\mu=19,\sigma=4)
\end{align*}
Because the mean and standard deviation describe a normal distribution exactly, they are called the distribution's \termsub{parameters}{parameter}.

\begin{exercise}
Write down the short-hand for a normal distribution with\footnote{(a)~$N(\mu=5,\sigma=3)$. (b)~$N(\mu=-100, \sigma=10)$. (c)~$N(\mu=2, \sigma=9)$.}
\begin{parts}
\item mean~5 and standard deviation~3,
\item mean~-100 and standard deviation~10, and
\item mean~2 and standard deviation~9.
\end{parts}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Standardizing with Z-scores}

\begin{example}{Table~\vref{satACTstats} shows the mean and standard deviation for total scores on the SAT and ACT. The distribution of SAT and ACT scores are both nearly normal. Suppose Ann scored 1800 on her SAT and Tom scored 24 on his ACT. Who performed better?}\label{actSAT}
We use the standard deviation as a guide. Ann is 1 standard deviation above average on the SAT: $1500 + 300=1800$. Tom is 0.6 standard deviations above the mean on the ACT: $21+0.6\times 5=24$. In Figure~\ref{satActNormals}, we can see that Ann tends to do better with respect to everyone else than Tom did, so her score was better.
\end{example}

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l r r}
  \hline
  & SAT & ACT \\
  \hline
Mean \hspace{0.3cm} & 1500 & 21 \\
SD & 300 & 5 \\
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Mean and standard deviation for the SAT and ACT.}
\label{satACTstats}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=65mm]{ch_distributions/figures/satActNormals/satActNormals}
\caption{Ann's and Tom's scores shown with the distributions of SAT and ACT scores.}
\label{satActNormals}
\end{figure}

Example~\ref{actSAT} used a standardization technique called a Z-score, a method most commonly employed for nearly normal observations but that may be used with any distribution. The \term{Z-score}\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-3mm}

$Z$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Z-score, the\\standardized\\observation]{\raggedright\vspace{-3mm}

$Z$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Z-score, the\\standardized\\observation}\index{Z@$Z$} of an observation is defined as the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean. If the observation is one standard deviation above the mean, its Z-score is 1. If it is 1.5 standard deviations \emph{below} the mean, then its Z-score is -1.5. If $x$ is an observation from a distribution $N(\mu, \sigma)$, we define the Z-score mathematically as
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
\end{eqnarray*}
Using $\mu_{SAT}=1500$, $\sigma_{SAT}=300$, and $x_{Ann}=1800$, we find Ann's Z-score:
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z_{Ann} = \frac{x_{Ann} - \mu_{SAT}}{\sigma_{SAT}} = \frac{1800-1500}{300} = 1
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{The Z-score}
The Z-score of an observation is the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean. We compute the Z-score for an observation $x$ that follows a distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ using
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
\end{eqnarray*}}
\end{termBox}

\begin{exercise}
Use Tom's ACT score, 24, along with the ACT mean and standard deviation to compute his Z-score.\footnote{$Z_{Tom} = \frac{x_{Tom} - \mu_{ACT}}{\sigma_{ACT}} = \frac{24 - 21}{5} = 0.6$}
\end{exercise}

Observations above the mean always have positive Z-scores while those below the mean have negative Z-scores. If an observation is equal to the mean (e.g. SAT score of 1500), then the Z-score is $0$.

\begin{exercise}
Let $X$ represent a random variable from $N(\mu=3, \sigma=2)$, and suppose we observe $x=5.19$. (a) Find the Z-score of $x$. (b) Use the Z-score to determine how many standard deviations above or below the mean $x$ falls.\footnote{(a) Its Z-score is given by $Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{5.19 - 3}{2} = 2.19/2 = 1.095$. (b) The observation $x$ is 1.095 standard deviations \emph{above} the mean. We know it must be above the mean since $Z$ is positive.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{headLZScore}
Head lengths of brushtail possums follow a nearly normal distribution with mean 92.6 mm and standard deviation 3.6 mm. Compute the Z-scores for possums with head lengths of 95.4 mm and 85.8 mm.\footnote{For $x_1=95.4$ mm: $Z_1 = \frac{x_1 - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{95.4 - 92.6}{3.6} = 0.78$. For $x_2=85.8$ mm: $Z_2 = \frac{85.8 - 92.6}{3.6} = -1.89$.}
\end{exercise}

We can use Z-scores to roughly identify which observations are more unusual than others. One observation $x_1$ is said to be more unusual than another observation $x_2$ if the absolute value of its Z-score is larger than the absolute value of the other observation's Z-score: $|Z_1| > |Z_2|$. This technique is especially insightful when a distribution is symmetric.

\begin{exercise}
Which of the observations in Guided Practice~\ref{headLZScore} is more unusual?\footnote{Because the \emph{absolute value} of Z-score for the second observation is larger than that of the first, the second observation has a more unusual head length.}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Normal probability table}

\begin{example}{Ann from Example~\ref{actSAT} earned a score of 1800 on her SAT with a corresponding $Z=1$. She would like to know what percentile she falls in among all SAT test-takers.}
Ann's \term{percentile} is the percentage of people who earned a lower SAT score than Ann. We shade the area representing those individuals in Figure~\ref{satBelow1800}. The total area under the normal curve is always equal to 1, and the proportion of people who scored below Ann on the SAT is equal to the \emph{area} shaded in Figure~\ref{satBelow1800}: 0.8413. In other words, Ann is in the $84^{th}$ percentile of SAT takers.
\end{example}

\begin{figure}[htb]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/satBelow1800/satBelow1800}
   \caption{The normal model for SAT scores, shading the area of those individuals who scored below Ann.}
   \label{satBelow1800}
\end{figure}

We can use the normal model to find percentiles. A \term{normal probability table}, which lists Z-scores and corresponding percentiles, can be used to identify a percentile based on the Z-score (and vice versa). Statistical software can also be used.

A normal probability table is given in Appendix~\vref{normalProbabilityTable} and abbreviated in Table~\ref{zTableShort}. We use this table to identify the percentile corresponding to any particular Z-score. For instance, the percentile of $Z=0.43$ is shown in row $0.4$ and column $0.03$ in Table~\ref{zTableShort}: 0.6664, or the $66.64^{th}$ percentile. Generally, we round $Z$ to two decimals, identify the proper row in the normal probability table up through the first decimal, and then determine the column representing the second decimal value. The intersection of this row and column is the percentile of the observation.

We can also find the Z-score associated with a percentile. For example, to identify Z for the $80^{th}$ percentile, we look for the value closest to 0.8000 in the middle portion of the table: 0.7995. We determine the Z-score for the $80^{th}$ percentile by combining the row and column Z values: 0.84.

\begin{exercise}
Determine the proportion of SAT test takers who scored better than Ann on the SAT.\footnote{If 84\% had lower scores than Ann, the proportion of people who had better scores must be 16\%. (Generally ties are ignored when the normal model, or any other continuous distribution, is used.)}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Normal probability examples}

Cumulative SAT scores are approximated well by a normal model, $N(\mu=1500, \sigma=300)$.

\begin{example}{Shannon is a randomly selected SAT taker, and nothing is known about Shannon's SAT aptitude. What is the probability Shannon scores at least 1630 on her SATs?}\label{satAbove1630Exam}
First, always draw and label a picture of the normal distribution. (Drawings need not be exact to be useful.) We are interested in the chance she scores above 1630, so we shade this upper tail:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/satAbove1630/satAbove1630}
\end{center}
The picture shows the mean and the values at 2 standard deviations above and below the mean. The simplest way to find the shaded area under the curve makes use of the Z-score of the cutoff value. With $\mu=1500$, $\sigma=300$, and the cutoff value $x=1630$, the Z-score is computed as
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{1630 - 1500}{300} = \frac{130}{300} = 0.43
\end{eqnarray*}
We look up the percentile of $Z=0.43$ in the normal probability table shown in Table~\ref{zTableShort} or in Appendix~\vref{normalProbabilityTable}, which yields 0.6664. However, the percentile describes those who had a Z-score \emph{lower} than 0.43. To find the area \emph{above} $Z=0.43$, we compute one minus the area of the lower tail:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/subtractingArea/subtractingArea}
\end{center}
The probability Shannon scores at least 1630 on the SAT is 0.3336.
\end{example}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{always draw a picture first, and find the Z-score second}
For any normal probability situation, \emph{always always always} draw and label the normal curve and shade the area of interest first. The picture will provide an estimate of the probability. \vspace{3mm}

After drawing a figure to represent the situation, identify the Z-score for the observation of interest.\vspace{1mm}}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{exercise}
If the probability of Shannon scoring at least 1630 is 0.3336, then what is the probability she scores less than 1630? Draw the normal curve representing this exercise, shading the lower region instead of the upper one.\footnote{We found the probability in Example~\ref{satAbove1630Exam}: 0.6664. A picture for this exercise is represented by the shaded area below ``0.6664'' in Example~\ref{satAbove1630Exam}.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{Edward earned a 1400 on his SAT. What is his percentile?} \label{edwardSatBelow1400}
First, a picture is needed. Edward's percentile is the proportion of people who do not get as high as a 1400. These are the scores to the left of 1400.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/satBelow1400/satBelow1400}
\end{center}
Identifying the mean $\mu=1500$, the standard deviation $\sigma=300$, and the cutoff for the tail area $x=1400$ makes it easy to compute the Z-score:
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{1400 - 1500}{300} = -0.33
\end{eqnarray*}
Using the normal probability table, identify the row of $-0.3$ and column of $0.03$, which corresponds to the probability $0.3707$. Edward is at the $37^{th}$ percentile.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Use the results of Example~\ref{edwardSatBelow1400} to compute the proportion of SAT takers who did better than Edward. Also draw a new picture.\footnote{If Edward did better than 37\% of SAT takers, then about 63\% must have done better than him. \\
\includegraphics[height=12mm]{ch_distributions/figures/satBelow1400/satAbove1400}}
\end{exercise}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{areas to the right}
The normal probability table in most books gives the area to the left. If you would like the area to the right, first find the area to the left and then subtract this amount from~one.}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{exercise}
Stuart earned an SAT score of 2100. Draw a picture for each part. (a)~What is his percentile? (b)~What percent of SAT takers did better than Stuart?\footnote{Numerical answers: (a) 0.9772. (b) 0.0228.}
\end{exercise}

Based on a sample of 100 men,\footnote{This sample was taken from the USDA Food Commodity Intake Database.} the heights of male adults between the ages 20 and 62 in the US is nearly normal with mean 70.0'' and standard deviation 3.3''.

\begin{exercise}
Mike is 5'7'' and Jim is 6'4''. (a) What is Mike's height percentile? (b) What is Jim's height percentile? Also draw one picture for each~part.\footnote{First put the heights into inches: 67 and 76 inches. Figures are shown below. (a) $Z_{Mike} = \frac{67 - 70}{3.3} = -0.91\ \to\ 0.1814$. (b) $Z_{Jim} = \frac{76 - 70}{3.3} = 1.82\ \to\ 0.9656$. \\\includegraphics[height=12mm]{ch_distributions/figures/mikeAndJimPercentiles/mikeAndJimPercentiles}}
\end{exercise}

The last several problems have focused on finding the probability or percentile for a particular observation. What if you would like to know the observation corresponding to a particular percentile?

\begin{example}{Erik's height is at the $40^{th}$ percentile. How tall is he?}\label{normalExam40Perc}
As always, first draw the picture.\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/height40Perc/height40Perc}\vspace{-1mm}
\end{center}
In this case, the lower tail probability is known (0.40), which can be shaded on the diagram. We want to find the observation that corresponds to this value. As a first step in this direction, we determine the Z-score associated with the $40^{th}$ percentile.

Because the percentile is below 50\%, we know $Z$ will be negative. Looking in the negative part of the normal probability table, we search for the probability \emph{inside} the table closest to 0.4000. We find that 0.4000 falls in row $-0.2$ and between columns $0.05$ and $0.06$. Since it falls closer to $0.05$, we take this one: $Z=-0.25$.

Knowing $Z_{Erik}=-0.25$ and the population parameters $\mu=70$ and $\sigma=3.3$ inches, the Z-score formula can be set up to determine Erik's unknown height, labeled $x_{Erik}$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
-0.25 = Z_{Erik} = \frac{x_{Erik} - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{x_{Erik} - 70}{3.3}
\end{eqnarray*}
Solving for $x_{Erik}$ yields the height 69.18 inches. That is, Erik is about 5'9'' (this is notation for 5-feet, 9-inches).
\end{example}

\begin{example}{What is the adult male height at the $82^{nd}$ percentile?}
Again, we draw the figure first.\textC{\vspace{-3mm}}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.28\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/height82Perc/height82Perc}\textC{\vspace{-1mm}}
\end{center}
Next, we want to find the Z-score at the $82^{nd}$ percentile, which will be a positive value. Looking in the Z-table, we find $Z$ falls in row $0.9$ and the nearest column is $0.02$, i.e. $Z=0.92$. Finally, the height $x$ is found using the Z-score formula with the known mean $\mu$, standard deviation $\sigma$, and Z-score $Z=0.92$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
0.92 = Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{x - 70}{3.3}
\end{eqnarray*}
This yields 73.04 inches or about 6'1'' as the height at the $82^{nd}$ percentile.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
(a) What is the $95^{th}$ percentile for SAT scores? (b) What is the $97.5^{th}$ percentile of the male heights? As always with normal probability problems, first draw a picture.\footnote{Remember: draw a picture first, then find the Z-score. (We leave the pictures to you.) The Z-score can be found by using the percentiles and the normal probability table. (a) We look for 0.95 in the probability portion (middle part) of the normal probability table, which leads us to row 1.6 and (about) column 0.05, i.e. $Z_{95}=1.65$. Knowing $Z_{95}=1.65$, $\mu = 1500$, and $\sigma = 300$, we setup the Z-score formula: $1.65 = \frac{x_{95} - 1500}{300}$. We solve for $x_{95}$: $x_{95} = 1995$. (b) Similarly, we find $Z_{97.5} = 1.96$, again setup the Z-score formula for the heights, and calculate $x_{97.5} = 76.5$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{more74Less69}
(a)~What is the probability that a randomly selected male adult is at least 6'2'' (74 inches)? (b)~What is the probability that a male adult is shorter than 5'9'' (69 inches)?\footnote{Numerical answers: (a) 0.1131. (b) 0.3821.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{What is the probability that a random adult male is between 5'9'' and 6'2''?}
These heights correspond to 69 inches and 74 inches. First, draw the figure. The area of interest is no longer an upper or lower tail.\textC{\vspace{-2mm}}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/between59And62/between59And62}\textC{\vspace{-2mm}}
\end{center}
The total area under the curve is~1. If we find the area of the two tails that are not shaded (from Guided Practice~\ref{more74Less69}, these areas are $0.3821$ and $0.1131$), then we can find the middle area:\textC{\vspace{-2mm}}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/subtracting2Areas/subtracting2Areas}\textC{\vspace{-2mm}}
\end{center}
That is, the probability of being between 5'9'' and 6'2'' is 0.5048.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
What percent of SAT takers get between 1500 and 2000?\footnote{This is an abbreviated solution. (Be sure to draw a figure!) First find the percent who get below 1500 and the percent that get above 2000: $Z_{1500} = 0.00 \to 0.5000$ (area below), $Z_{2000} = 1.67 \to 0.0475$ (area above). Final answer: $1.0000-0.5000 - 0.0475 = 0.4525$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What percent of adult males are between 5'5'' and 5'7''?\footnote{5'5'' is 65 inches. 5'7'' is 67 inches. Numerical solution: $1.000 - 0.0649 - 0.8183 = 0.1168$, i.e. 11.68\%.}
\end{exercise}

\CalculatorVideos{calculations for the normal distribution}


\subsection{68-95-99.7 rule}

Here, we present a useful rule of thumb for the probability of falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution. This will be useful in a wide range of practical settings, especially when trying to make a quick estimate without a calculator or Z-table.

\begin{figure}[hht]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=1.9in]{ch_distributions/figures/6895997/6895997}
\caption{Probabilities for falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution.}
\label{6895997}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
Use the Z-table to confirm that about 68\%, 95\%, and 99.7\% of observations fall within 1, 2, and 3, standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution, respectively. For instance, first find the area that falls between $Z=-1$ and $Z=1$, which should have an area of about 0.68. Similarly there should be an area of about 0.95 between $Z=-2$ and $Z=2$.\footnote{First draw the pictures. To find the area between $Z=-1$ and $Z=1$, use the normal probability table to determine the areas below $Z=-1$ and above $Z=1$. Next verify the area between $Z=-1$ and $Z=1$ is about 0.68. Repeat this for $Z=-2$ to $Z=2$ and also for $Z=-3$ to $Z=3$.}
\end{exercise}

It is possible for a normal random variable to fall 4,~5, or~even more standard deviations from the mean. However, these occurrences are very rare if the data are nearly normal. The probability of being further than 4 standard deviations from the mean is about 1-in-15,000. For 5 and 6 standard deviations, it is about 1-in-2 million and 1-in-500 million, respectively.

\begin{exercise}
SAT scores closely follow the normal model with mean $\mu = 1500$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 300$. (a) About what percent of test takers score 900 to 2100? (b) What percent score between 1500 and 2100?\footnote{(a) 900 and 2100 represent two standard deviations above and below the mean, which means about 95\% of test takers will score between 900 and 2100. (b)~Since the normal model is symmetric, then half of the test takers from part~(a) ($\frac{95\%}{2} = 47.5\%$ of all test takers) will score 900 to 1500 while 47.5\% score between 1500 and 2100.}
\end{exercise}

\section{Evaluating the normal approximation}
\label{assessingNormal}

Many processes can be well approximated by the normal distribution. We have already seen two good examples: SAT scores and the heights of US adult males. While using a normal model can be extremely convenient and helpful, it is important to remember normality is always an approximation. Testing the appropriateness of the normal assumption is a key step in many data analyses.

\index{normal probability plot|(}

Example~\ref{normalExam40Perc} suggests the distribution of heights of US males is well approximated by the normal model. We are interested in proceeding under the assumption that the data are normally distributed, but first we must check to see if this is reasonable.

There are two visual methods for checking the assumption of normality, which can be implemented and interpreted quickly. The first is a simple histogram with the best fitting normal curve overlaid on the plot, as shown in the left panel of Figure~\ref{fcidMHeights}. The sample mean $\bar{x}$ and standard deviation $s$ are used as the parameters of the best fitting normal curve. The closer this curve fits the histogram, the more reasonable the normal model assumption. Another more common method is examining a \term{normal probability plot},\footnote{Also commonly called a \term{quantile-quantile plot}.} shown in the right panel of Figure~\ref{fcidMHeights}. The closer the points are to a perfect straight line, the more confident we can be that the data follow the normal model.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/fcidMHeights/fcidMHeights}
\caption{A sample of 100 male heights. The observations are rounded to the nearest whole inch, explaining why the points appear to jump in increments in the normal probability plot.}
\label{fcidMHeights}
\end{figure}

\textC{\newpage}

\begin{example}{Three data sets of 40, 100, and 400 samples were simulated from a normal distribution, and the histograms and normal probability plots of the data sets are shown in Figure~\ref{normalExamples}. These will provide a benchmark for what to look for in plots of real data.} \label{normalExamplesExample}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/normalExamples/normalExamples}
\caption{Histograms and normal probability plots for three simulated normal data sets; $n=40$ (left), $n=100$ (middle), $n=400$ (right).}
\label{normalExamples}
\end{figure}

The left panels show the histogram (top) and normal probability plot (bottom) for the simulated data set with 40 observations. The data set is too small to really see clear structure in the histogram. The normal probability plot also reflects this, where there are some deviations from the line. We should expect deviations of this amount for such a small data set.

The middle panels show diagnostic plots for the data set with 100 simulated observations. The histogram shows more normality and the normal probability plot shows a better fit. While there are a few observations that deviate noticeably from the line, they are not particularly extreme.

The data set with 400 observations has a histogram that greatly resembles the normal distribution, while the normal probability plot is nearly a perfect straight line. Again in the normal probability plot there is one observation (the largest) that deviates slightly from the line. If that observation had deviated 3 times further from the line, it would be of greater importance in a real data set. Apparent outliers can occur in normally distributed data but they are rare.

Notice the histograms look more normal as the sample size increases, and the normal probability plot becomes straighter and more stable.

\begin{example}{Are NBA player heights normally distributed? Consider all 435 NBA players from the 2008-9 season presented in Figure~\ref{nbaNormal}.\footnote{These data were collected from \oiRedirect{textbook-nba_com}{www.nba.com}.}}
We first create a histogram and normal probability plot of the NBA player heights. The histogram in the left panel is slightly left skewed, which contrasts with the symmetric normal distribution. The points in the normal probability plot do not appear to closely follow a straight line but show what appears to be a ``wave''. We can compare these characteristics to the sample of 400 normally distributed observations in Example~\ref{normalExamplesExample} and see that they represent much stronger deviations from the normal model. NBA player heights do not appear to come from a normal distribution.

Determine which data sets represented in Figure~\ref{normalQuantileExer} plausibly come from a nearly normal distribution. Are you confident in all of your conclusions? There are 100 (top left), 50 (top right), 500 (bottom left), and 15 points (bottom right) in the four plots.\footnote{Answers may vary a little. The top-left plot shows some deviations in the smallest values in the data set; specifically, the left tail of the data set has some outliers we should be wary of. The top-right and bottom-left plots do not show any obvious or extreme deviations from the lines for their respective sample sizes, so a normal model would be reasonable for these data sets. The bottom-right plot has a consistent curvature that suggests it is not from the normal distribution. If we examine just the vertical coordinates of these observations, we see that there is a lot of data between -20 and 0, and then about five observations scattered between 0 and 70. This describes a distribution that has a strong right skew.}

%When observations spike downwards on the left side of a normal probability plot, it means the data have more outliers in the left tail than we'd expect under a normal distribution.

In the first plot, most points are near the low end with fewer observations scattered along the high end; this describes a distribution that is skewed to the high end. The second plot shows the opposite features, and this distribution is skewed to the low end.}

\section{Geometric distribution (special topic)}
\label{geomDist}

How long should we expect to flip a coin until it turns up \resp{heads}? Or how many times should we expect to roll a die until we get a \resp{1}? These questions can be answered using the geometric distribution. We first formalize each trial -- such as a single coin flip or die toss -- using the Bernoulli distribution, and then we combine these with our tools from probability (Chapter~\ref{probability}) to construct the geometric distribution.

\subsection{Bernoulli distribution}
\label{bernoulli}

\index{distribution!Bernoulli|(}

Stanley Milgram\index{Milgram, Stanley} began a series of experiments in 1963 to estimate what proportion of people would willingly obey an authority and give severe shocks to a stranger. Milgram found that about 65\% of people would obey the authority and give such shocks. Over the years, additional research suggested this number is approximately consistent across communities and time.\footnote{Find further information on Milgram's experiment at \par \ \ \hspace{0.2mm}\ \oiRedirect{textbook-milgram}{www.cnr.berkeley.edu/ucce50/ag-labor/7article/article35.htm}.}

Each person in Milgram's experiment can be thought of as a \term{trial}. We label a person a \term{success} if she refuses to administer the worst shock. A person is labeled a \term{failure} if she administers the worst shock. Because only 35\% of individuals refused to administer the most severe shock, we denote the \term{probability of a success} with $p=0.35$. The probability of a failure is sometimes denoted with $q=1-p$.

Thus, \resp{success} or \resp{failure} is recorded for each person in the study. When an individual trial only has two possible outcomes, it is called a \termsub{Bernoulli random variable}{distribution!Bernoulli}.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Bernoulli random variable, descriptive}
A Bernoulli random variable has exactly two possible outcomes. We typically label one of these outcomes a ``success'' and the other outcome a ``failure''. We may also denote a success by \resp{1} and a failure by \resp{0}.}
\end{termBox}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{``success'' need not be something positive}
We chose to label a person who refuses to administer the worst shock a ``success'' and all others as ``failures''. However, we could just as easily have reversed these labels. The mathematical framework we will build does not depend on which outcome is labeled a success and which a failure, as long as we are consistent.}
\end{tipBox}

Bernoulli random variables are often denoted as \resp{1} for a success and \resp{0} for a failure. In addition to being convenient in entering data, it is also mathematically handy. Suppose we observe ten trials:
\begin{center}
\resp{0} \resp{1} \resp{1} \resp{1} \resp{1} \resp{0} \resp{1} \resp{1} \resp{0} \resp{0}
\end{center}
Then the \term{sample proportion}, $\hat{p}$, is the sample mean of these observations:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{p} = \frac{\text{\# of successes}}{\text{\# of trials}} = \frac{0+1+1+1+1+0+1+1+0+0}{10} = 0.6
\end{eqnarray*}%
This mathematical inquiry of Bernoulli random variables can be extended even further. Because \resp{0} and \resp{1} are numerical outcomes, we can define the {mean} and {standard deviation} of a Bernoulli random variable.\footnote{If ${p}$ is the true probability of a success, then the mean of a Bernoulli random variable $X$ is given by
\begin{align*}
\mu = E[X] &= P(X=0)\times0 + P(X=1)\times1 \\
	&= (1-p)\times0 + p\times 1 = 0+p = p
\end{align*}
Similarly, the variance of $X$ can be computed:
\begin{align*}
\sigma^2 &= {P(X=0)(0-p)^2 + P(X=1)(1-p)^2} \\
	&= {(1-p)p^2 + p(1-p)^2} = {p(1-p)}
\end{align*}
The standard deviation is $\sigma=\sqrt{p(1-p)}$.}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Bernoulli random variable, mathematical}
If $X$ is a random variable that takes value 1 with probability of success $p$ and 0 with probability $1-p$, then $X$ is a Bernoulli random variable with mean and standard deviation
\begin{align*}
\mu &= p
	&\sigma&= \sqrt{p(1-p)}
\end{align*}}
\end{termBox}

In general, it is useful to think about a Bernoulli random variable as a random process with only two outcomes: a success or failure. Then we build our mathematical framework using the numerical labels \resp{1} and \resp{0} for successes and failures, respectively.

\index{distribution!Bernoulli|)}

\subsection{Geometric distribution}

\index{distribution!geometric|(}

\begin{example}{Dr. Smith wants to repeat Milgram's experiments but she only wants to sample people until she finds someone who will not inflict the worst shock.\footnote{This is hypothetical since, in reality, this sort of study probably would not be permitted any longer under current ethical standards.} If the probability a person will \emph{not} give the most severe shock is still 0.35 and the subjects are independent, what are the chances that she will stop the study after the first person? The second person? The third? What about if it takes her $n-1$ individuals who will administer the worst shock before finding her first success, i.e. the first success is on the $n^{th}$ person? (If the first success is the fifth person, then we say $n=5$.)} \label{waitForShocker}
The probability of stopping after the first person is just the chance the first person will not administer the worst shock: $1-0.65=0.35$. The probability it will be the second person is
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&P(\text{second person is the first to not administer the worst shock}) \\
&&\quad = P(\text{the first will, the second won't}) = (0.65)(0.35) = 0.228
\end{eqnarray*}
Likewise, the probability it will be the third person is $(0.65)(0.65)(0.35) = 0.148$.

If the first success is on the $n^{th}$ person, then there are $n-1$ failures and finally 1 success, which corresponds to the probability $(0.65)^{n-1}(0.35)$. This is the same as $(1-0.35)^{n-1}(0.35)$.
\end{example}

Example~\ref{waitForShocker} illustrates what is called the geometric distribution, which describes the waiting time until a success for \term{independent and identically distributed (iid)} Bernoulli random variables. In this case, the \emph{independence} aspect just means the individuals in the example don't affect each other, and \emph{identical} means they each have the same probability of success.

The geometric distribution from Example~\ref{waitForShocker} is shown in Figure~\ref{geometricDist35}. In general, the probabilities for a geometric distribution decrease \term{exponentially} fast.

While this text will not derive the formulas for the mean (expected) number of trials needed to find the first success or the standard deviation or variance of this distribution, we present general formulas for each.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Geometric Distribution\index{distribution!geometric|textbf}}
If the probability of a success in one trial is $p$ and the probability of a failure is $1-p$, then the probability of finding the first success in the $n^{th}$ trial is given by\vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{eqnarray}
(1-p)^{n-1}p
\end{eqnarray}
The mean (i.e. expected value), variance, and standard deviation of this wait time are given by\vspace{-2.5mm}
\begin{align}
\mu &= \frac{1}{p}
	&\sigma^2&=\frac{1-p}{p^2}
	&\sigma &= \sqrt{\frac{1-p}{p^2}}
\label{geomFormulas}
\end{align}}
\end{termBox}

It is no accident that we use the symbol $\mu$ for both the mean and expected value. The mean and the expected value are one and the same.

The left side of Equation~(\ref{geomFormulas}) says that, on average, it takes $1/p$ trials to get a success. This mathematical result is consistent with what we would expect intuitively. If the probability of a success is high (e.g. 0.8), then we don't usually wait very long for a success: $1/0.8 = 1.25$ trials on average. If the probability of a success is low (e.g. 0.1), then we would expect to view many trials before we see a success: $1/0.1 = 10$ trials.

\begin{exercise}
The probability that an individual would refuse to administer the worst shock is said to be about 0.35. If we were to examine individuals until we found one that did not administer the shock, how many people should we expect to check? The first expression in Equation~(\ref{geomFormulas}) may be useful.\footnote{We would expect to see about $1/0.35 = 2.86$ individuals to find the first success.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{What is the chance that Dr. Smith will find the first success within the first 4 people?} \label{marglimFirstSuccessIn4}
This is the chance it is the first ($n=1$), second ($n=2$), third ($n=3$), or fourth ($n=4$) person as the first success, which are four disjoint outcomes. Because the individuals in the sample are randomly sampled from a large population, they are independent. We compute the probability of each case and add the separate results:
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&P(n=1, 2, 3,\text{ or }4) \\
	&& \quad = P(n=1)+P(n=2)+P(n=3)+P(n=4) \\
	&& \quad = (0.65)^{1-1}(0.35) + (0.65)^{2-1}(0.35) + (0.65)^{3-1}(0.35) + (0.65)^{4-1}(0.35) \\
	&& \quad = 0.82
\end{eqnarray*}
There is an 82\% chance that she will end the study within 4~people.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Determine a more clever way to solve Example~\ref{marglimFirstSuccessIn4}. Show that you get the same result.\footnote{First find the probability of the complement: $P($no success in first 4~trials$) = 0.65^4 = 0.18$. Next, compute one minus this probability: $1-P($no success in 4 trials$) = 1-0.18 = 0.82$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{Suppose in one region it was found that the proportion of people who would administer the worst shock was ``only'' 55\%. If people were randomly selected from this region, what is the expected number of people who must be checked before one was found that would be deemed a success? What is the standard deviation of this waiting time?} \label{onlyShocking55PercOfTheTimeExample}
A success is when someone will \textbf{not} inflict the worst shock, which has probability $p=1-0.55=0.45$ for this region. The expected number of people to be checked is $1/p = 1/0.45 = 2.22$ and the standard deviation is $\sqrt{(1-p)/p^2} = 1.65$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Using the results from Example~\ref{onlyShocking55PercOfTheTimeExample}, $\mu = 2.22$ and $\sigma = 1.65$, would it be appropriate to use the normal model to find what proportion of experiments would end in 3 or fewer trials?\footnote{No. The geometric distribution is always right skewed and can never be well-approximated by the normal model.}
\end{exercise}

The independence assumption is crucial to the geometric distribution's accurate description of a scenario. Mathematically, we can see that to construct the probability of the success on the $n^{th}$ trial, we had to use the Multiplication Rule for Independent Processes. It is no simple task to generalize the geometric model for dependent trials.

\begin{example}{Suppose we randomly selected four individuals to participate in the ``shock" study. What is the chance exactly one of them will be a success?  Let's call the four people Allen ($A$), Brittany ($B$), Caroline ($C$), and Damian ($D$) for convenience. Also, suppose 35\% of people are successes as in the previous version of this example.}\label{oneRefuser}
Let's consider a scenario where one person refuses:
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&P(A=\text{\resp{refuse}},\text{ }B=\text{\resp{shock}},\text{ }C=\text{\resp{shock}},\text{ }D=\text{\resp{shock}}) \\
 &&\quad =  P(A=\text{\resp{refuse}})\ P(B=\text{\resp{shock}})\ P(C=\text{\resp{shock}})\ P(D=\text{\resp{shock}}) \\
 &&\quad =  (0.35)  (0.65)  (0.65)  (0.65) = (0.35)^1 (0.65)^3 = 0.096
\end{eqnarray*}
But there are three other scenarios: Brittany, Caroline, or Damian could have been the one to refuse. In each of these cases, the probability is again $(0.35)^1(0.65)^3$. These four scenarios exhaust all the possible ways that exactly one of these four people could refuse to administer the most severe shock, so the total probability is $4\times(0.35)^1(0.65)^3 = 0.38$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Verify that the scenario where Brittany is the only one to refuse to give the most severe shock has probability $(0.35)^1(0.65)^3$.~\footnote{$P(A=\text{\resp{shock}},\text{ }B=\text{\resp{refuse}},\text{ }C=\text{\resp{shock}},\text{ }D=\text{\resp{shock}}) = (0.65)(0.35)(0.65)(0.65) = (0.35)^1(0.65)^3$.}
\end{exercise}

\textC{\newpage}


\subsection{The binomial distribution}

The scenario outlined in Example~\ref{oneRefuser} is a special case of what is called the binomial distribution. The \termsub{binomial distribution}{distribution!binomial} describes the probability of having exactly $k$ successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials with probability of a success $p$  (in Example~\ref{oneRefuser}, $n=4$, $k=1$, $p=0.35$). We would like to determine the probabilities associated with the binomial distribution more generally, i.e. we want a formula where we can use $n$, $k$, and $p$ to obtain the probability. To do this, we reexamine each part of the example.

There were four individuals who could have been the one to refuse, and each of these four scenarios had the same probability. Thus, we could identify the final probability as
\begin{eqnarray}
[\text{\# of scenarios}] \times P(\text{single scenario})
\label{genBinomialFormula}
\end{eqnarray}
The first component of this equation is the number of ways to arrange the $k=1$ successes among the $n=4$ trials. The second component is the probability of any of the four (equally probable) scenarios.

Consider $P($single scenario$)$ under the general case of $k$ successes and $n-k$ failures in the $n$ trials. In any such scenario, we apply the Multiplication Rule for independent events:
\begin{eqnarray*}
p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
\end{eqnarray*}
This is our general formula for $P($single scenario$)$.

Secondly, we introduce a general formula for the number of ways to choose $k$ successes in $n$ trials, i.e. arrange $k$ successes and $n-k$ failures:
\begin{eqnarray*}
{n\choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\end{eqnarray*}
The quantity ${n\choose k}$ is read \term{n choose k}.\footnote{Other notation for $n$ choose $k$ includes $_nC_k$, $C_n^k$, and $C(n,k)$.} The exclamation point notation (e.g. $k!$) denotes a \term{factorial}\label{factorialDefinitionInTheBinomialSection} expression.
\begin{eqnarray*}
&& 0! = 1 \label{zeroFactorial} \\
&& 1! = 1 \\
&& 2! = 2\times1 = 2 \\
&& 3! = 3\times2\times1 = 6 \\
&& 4! = 4\times3\times2\times1 = 24 \\
&& \vdots \\
&& n! = n\times(n-1)\times...\times3\times2\times1
\end{eqnarray*}
Using the formula, we can compute the number of ways to choose $k=1$ successes in $n=4$ trials:
\begin{eqnarray*}
{4 \choose 1} = \frac{4!}{1!(4-1)!} =  \frac{4!}{1!3!} 
	= \frac{4\times3\times2\times1}{(1)(3\times2\times1)} = 4
\end{eqnarray*}
This result is exactly what we found by carefully thinking of each possible scenario in Example~\ref{oneRefuser}.

Substituting $n$ choose $k$ for the number of scenarios and $p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$ for the single scenario probability in Equation~(\ref{genBinomialFormula}) yields the general binomial formula.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Binomial distribution} Suppose the probability of a single trial being a success is $p$. Then the probability of observing exactly $k$ successes in $n$ independent trials is given by\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{eqnarray}
{n\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
\label{binomialFormula}
\end{eqnarray}
Additionally, the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the number of observed successes are\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{align}
\mu &= np
	&\sigma^2 &= np(1-p)
	&\sigma &= \sqrt{np(1-p)}
\label{binomialStats}
\end{align}}
\end{termBox}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Is it binomial? Four conditions to check.\label{isItBinomialTipBox}}
(1) The trials are independent. \\
(2) The number of trials, $n$, is fixed. \\
(3) Each trial outcome can be classified as a \emph{success} or \emph{failure}. \\
(4) The probability of a success, $p$, is the same for each trial.}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{example}{What is the probability that 3 of 8 randomly selected students will refuse to administer the worst shock, i.e. 5 of 8 will?}
We would like to apply the binomial model, so we check our conditions. The number of trials is fixed ($n=8$) (condition 2) and each trial outcome can be classified as a success or failure (condition 3). Because the sample is random, the trials are independent (condition~1) and the probability of a success is the same for each trial (condition~4).

In the outcome of interest, there are $k=3$ successes in $n=8$ trials, and the probability of a success is $p=0.35$. So the probability that 3 of 8 will refuse is given by
\begin{eqnarray*}
{ 8 \choose 3}(0.35)^3(1-0.35)^{8-3}
	&=& \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!}(0.35)^3(1-0.35)^{8-3} \\
	&=& \frac{8!}{3!5!}(0.35)^3(0.65)^5
\end{eqnarray*}
Dealing with the factorial part:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \frac{8\times7\times6\times5\times4\times3\times2\times1}{(3\times2\times1)(5\times4\times3\times2\times1)} = \frac{8\times7\times6}{3\times2\times1} = 56
\end{eqnarray*}
Using $(0.35)^3(0.65)^5 \approx 0.005$, the final probability is about $56*0.005 = 0.28$.
\end{example}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{computing binomial probabilities}
The first step in using the binomial model is to check that the model is appropriate. The second step is to identify $n$, $p$, and $k$. The final step is to apply the formulas and interpret the results.}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{computing $n$ choose $k$}
In general, it is useful to do some cancelation in the factorials immediately. Alternatively, many computer programs and calculators have built in functions to compute $n$ choose $k$, factorials, and even entire binomial probabilities.}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{exercise}
If you ran a study and randomly sampled 40 students, how many would you expect to refuse to administer the worst shock? What is the standard deviation of the number of people who would refuse? Equation~(\ref{binomialStats}) may be useful.\footnote{We are asked to determine the expected number (the mean) and the standard deviation, both of which can be directly computed from the formulas in Equation~(\ref{binomialStats}): $\mu=np = 40\times 0.35 = 14$ and $\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)} = \sqrt{40\times 0.35\times 0.65} = 3.02$. Because very roughly 95\% of observations fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean (see Section~\ref{variability}), we would probably observe at least 8 but less than 20 individuals in our sample who would refuse to administer the shock.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
The probability that a random smoker will develop a severe lung condition in his or her lifetime is about $0.3$. If you have 4 friends who smoke, are the conditions for the binomial model satisfied?\footnote{One possible answer: if the friends know each other, then the independence assumption is probably not satisfied. For example, acquaintances may have similar smoking habits.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
\label{noMoreThanOneFriendWSevereLungCondition}%
Suppose these four friends do not know each other and we can treat them as if they were a random sample from the population. Is the binomial model appropriate? What is the probability that (a) none of them will develop a severe lung condition? (b) One will develop a severe lung condition? (c) That no more than one will develop a severe lung condition?\footnote{To check if the binomial model is appropriate, we must verify the conditions. (i) Since we are supposing we can treat the friends as a random sample, they are independent. (ii) We have a fixed number of trials ($n=4$). (iii) Each outcome is a success or failure. (iv) The probability of a success is the same for each trials since the individuals are like a random sample ($p=0.3$ if we say a ``success'' is someone getting a lung condition, a morbid choice). Compute parts (a) and (b) from the binomial formula in Equation~\eqref{binomialFormula}: $P(0) =  {4 \choose 0} (0.3)^0 (0.7)^4 = 1\times1\times0.7^4 = 0.2401$, $P(1) = {4 \choose 1} (0.3)^1(0.7)^{3} = 0.4116$. Note: $0!=1$, as shown on page~\pageref{zeroFactorial}. Part (c) can be computed as the sum of parts (a) and (b): $P(0) + P(1) = 0.2401 + 0.4116 = 0.6517$. That is, there is about a 65\% chance that no more than one of your four smoking friends will develop a severe lung condition.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What is the probability that at least 2 of your 4 smoking friends will develop a severe lung condition in their lifetimes?\footnote{The complement (no more than one will develop a severe lung condition) as computed in Guided Practice~\ref{noMoreThanOneFriendWSevereLungCondition} as 0.6517, so we compute one minus this value: 0.3483.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Suppose you have 7 friends who are smokers and they can be treated as a random sample of smokers. (a) How many would you expect to develop a severe lung condition, i.e. what is the mean? (b) What is the probability that at most 2 of your 7 friends will develop a severe lung condition.\footnote{(a)~$\mu=0.3\times7 = 2.1$. (b)~$P($0, 1, or 2 develop severe lung condition$) = P(k=0) + P(k=1)+P(k=2) = 0.6471$.}
\end{exercise}

Next we consider the first term in the binomial probability, $n$ choose $k$ under some special scenarios.

\begin{exercise}
Why is it true that ${n \choose 0}=1$ and ${n \choose n}=1$ for any number $n$?\footnote{Frame these expressions into words. How many different ways are there to arrange 0 successes and $n$ failures in $n$ trials? (1 way.) How many different ways are there to arrange $n$ successes and 0 failures in $n$ trials? (1 way.)}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
How many ways can you arrange one success and $n-1$ failures in $n$ trials? How many ways can you arrange $n-1$ successes and one failure in $n$ trials?\footnote{One success and $n-1$ failures: there are exactly $n$ unique places we can put the success, so there are $n$ ways to arrange one success and $n-1$ failures. A similar argument is used for the second question. Mathematically, we show these results by verifying the following two equations:
\begin{eqnarray*}
{n \choose 1} = n, \qquad {n \choose n-1} = n
\end{eqnarray*}}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Normal approximation to the binomial distribution}
\label{normalApproxBinomialDistSubsection}

\index{distribution!binomial!normal approximation|(}

The binomial formula is cumbersome when the sample size ($n$) is large, particularly when we consider a range of observations. In some cases we may use the normal distribution as an easier and faster way to estimate binomial probabilities.

\begin{example}{Approximately 20\% of the US population smokes cigarettes. A local government believed their community had a lower smoker rate and commissioned a survey of 400 randomly selected individuals. The survey found that only 59 of the 400 participants smoke cigarettes. If the true proportion of smokers in the community was really 20\%, what is the probability of observing 59 or fewer smokers in a sample of 400 people?}\label{exactBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample}
We leave the usual verification that the four conditions for the binomial model are valid as an exercise.

The question posed is equivalent to asking, what is the probability of observing $k=0$, 1, ..., 58, or 59 smokers in a sample of $n=400$ when $p=0.20$? We can compute these 60 different probabilities and add them together to find the answer:
\begin{align*}
&P(k=0\text{ or }k=1\text{ or }\cdots\text{ or } k=59) \\
	&\qquad= P(k=0) + P(k=1) + \cdots + P(k=59) \\
	&\qquad=0.0041
\end{align*}
If the true proportion of smokers in the community is $p=0.20$, then the probability of observing 59 or fewer smokers in a sample of $n=400$ is less than 0.0041.
\end{example}

The computations in Example~\ref{exactBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample} are tedious and long. In general, we should avoid such work if an alternative method exists that is faster, easier, and still accurate. Recall that calculating probabilities of a range of values is much easier in the normal model. We might wonder, is it reasonable to use the normal model in place of the binomial distribution? Surprisingly, yes, if certain conditions are met.

\begin{exercise}
Here we consider the binomial model when the probability of a success is $p=0.10$. Figure~\ref{fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal} shows four hollow histograms for simulated samples from the binomial distribution using four different sample sizes: $n=10, 30, 100, 300$. What happens to the shape of the distributions as the sample size increases? What distribution does the last hollow histogram resemble?\footnote{The distribution is transformed from a blocky and skewed distribution into one that rather resembles the normal distribution in last hollow histogram}
\end{exercise}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.92\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal/fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal}
\caption{Hollow histograms of samples from the binomial model when $p=0.10$. The sample sizes for the four plots are $n=10$, 30, 100, and 300, respectively.}
\label{fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal}
\end{figure}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Normal approximation of the binomial distribution}
The binomial distribution with probability of success $p$ is nearly normal when the sample size $n$ is sufficiently large that $np$ and $n(1-p)$ are both at least 10. The approximate normal distribution has parameters corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of the binomial distribution:\vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{align*}
\mu &= np
&&\sigma= \sqrt{np(1-p)}
\end{align*}}
\end{termBox}

The normal approximation may be used when computing the range of many possible successes. For instance, we may apply the normal distribution to the setting of Example~\ref{exactBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample}.

\begin{example}{How can we use the normal approximation to estimate the probability of observing 59 or fewer smokers in a sample of 400, if the true proportion of smokers is $p=0.20$?} \label{approxBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample}
Showing that the binomial model is reasonable was a suggested exercise in Example~\ref{exactBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample}. We also verify that both $np$ and $n(1-p)$ are at least 10:
\begin{align*}
np&=400\times 0.20=80
&n(1-p)&=400\times 0.8=320
\end{align*}
With these conditions checked, we may use the normal approximation in place of the binomial distribution using the mean and standard deviation from the binomial model:
\begin{align*}
\mu &= np = 80
&\sigma &= \sqrt{np(1-p)} = 8
\end{align*}
We want to find the probability of observing fewer than 59 smokers using this model.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Use the normal model $N(\mu=80, \sigma=8)$ to estimate the probability of observing fewer than 59 smokers. Your answer should be approximately equal to the solution of Example~\ref{exactBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample}: 0.0041.\footnote{Compute the Z-score first: $Z=\frac{59 - 80}{8} = -2.63$. The corresponding left tail area is 0.0043.}
\end{exercise}


\subsection{The normal approximation breaks down on small intervals}

\begin{caution}
{The normal approximation may fail on small intervals}
{The normal approximation to the binomial distribution tends to perform poorly when estimating the probability of a small range of counts, even when the conditions are met.}
\end{caution}

Suppose we wanted to compute the probability of observing 69, 70, or 71 smokers in 400 when $p=0.20$. With such a large sample, we might be tempted to apply the normal approximation and use the range 69 to 71. However, we would find that the binomial solution and the normal approximation notably differ:
\begin{align*}
\text{Binomial:}&\ 0.0703
&\text{Normal:}&\ 0.0476
\end{align*}
We can identify the cause of this discrepancy using Figure~\ref{normApproxToBinomFail}, which shows the areas representing the binomial probability (outlined) and normal approximation (shaded). Notice that the width of the area under the normal distribution is 0.5 units too slim on both sides of the interval.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/normApproxToBinomFail/normApproxToBinomFail}
\caption{A normal curve with the area between 69 and 71 shaded. The outlined area represents the exact binomial probability.}
\label{normApproxToBinomFail}
\end{figure}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Improving the accuracy of the normal approximation to the binomial distribution}
The normal approximation to the binomial distribution for intervals of values is usually improved if cutoff values are modified slightly. The cutoff values for the lower end of a shaded region should be reduced by 0.5, and the cutoff value for the upper end should be increased by 0.5.}
\end{tipBox}

The tip to add extra area when applying the normal approximation is most often useful when examining a range of observations. While it is possible to apply it when computing a tail area, the benefit of the modification usually disappears since the total interval is typically quite wide.

\section{More discrete distributions (special topic)}
\label{discreteModels}

\subsection{Negative binomial distribution}
\label{negativeBinomial}

\index{distribution!negative binomial|(}

The geometric distribution describes the probability of observing the first success on the $n^{th}$ trial. The \termsub{negative binomial distribution}{distribution!negative binomial} is more general: it describes the probability of observing the $k^{th}$ success on the $n^{th}$ trial.

\begin{example}{Each day a high school football coach tells his star kicker, Brian, that he can go home after he successfully kicks four 35 yard field goals. Suppose we say each kick has a probability $p$ of being successful. If $p$ is small -- e.g. close to 0.1 -- would we expect Brian to need many attempts before he successfully kicks his fourth field goal?}
We are waiting for the fourth success ($k=4$). If the probability of a success ($p$) is small, then the number of attempts ($n$) will probably be large. This means that Brian is more likely to need many attempts before he gets $k=4$ successes. To put this another way, the probability of $n$ being small is low.
\end{example}

To identify a negative binomial case, we check 4 conditions. The first three are common to the binomial distribution.\footnote{See a similar guide for the binomial distribution on page~\pageref{isItBinomialTipBox}.}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Is it negative binomial? Four conditions to check.}
(1) The trials are independent. \\
(2) Each trial outcome can be classified as a success or failure. \\
(3) The probability of a success ($p$) is the same for each trial. \\
(4) The last trial must be a success.}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{exercise}
Suppose Brian is very diligent in his attempts and he makes each 35 yard field goal with probability $p=0.8$. Take a guess at how many attempts he would need before making his fourth kick.\footnote{One possible answer: since he is likely to make each field goal attempt, it will take him at least 4 attempts but probably not more than 6 or 7.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{In yesterday's practice, it took Brian only 6 tries to get his fourth field goal. Write out each of the possible sequence of kicks.} \label{eachSeqOfSixTriesToGetFourSuccesses}
Because it took Brian six tries to get the fourth success, we know the last kick must have been a success. That leaves three successful kicks and two unsuccessful kicks (we label these as failures) that make up the first five attempts. There are ten possible sequences of these first five kicks, which are shown in Table~\ref{successFailureOrdersForBriansFieldGoals}. If Brian achieved his fourth success ($k=4$) on his sixth attempt ($n=6$), then his order of successes and failures must be one of these ten possible sequences.

\label{successFailureOrdersForBriansFieldGoals}
\end{table}

\end{example}

\begin{exercise} \label{probOfEachSeqOfSixTriesToGetFourSuccesses}
Each sequence in Table~\ref{successFailureOrdersForBriansFieldGoals} has exactly two failures and four successes with the last attempt always being a success. If the probability of a success is $p=0.8$, find the probability of the first sequence.\footnote{The first sequence: $0.2\times0.2\times0.8\times0.8\times0.8\times0.8 = 0.0164$.}
\end{exercise}

If the probability Brian kicks a 35 yard field goal is $p=0.8$, what is the probability it takes Brian exactly six tries to get his fourth successful kick? We can write this as
{\small\begin{align*}
&P(\text{it takes Brian six tries to make four field goals}) \\
& \quad = P(\text{Brian makes three of his first five field goals, and he makes the sixth one}) \\
& \quad = P(\text{$1^{st}$ sequence OR $2^{nd}$ sequence OR ... OR $10^{th}$ sequence})
\end{align*}
}where the sequences are from Table~\ref{successFailureOrdersForBriansFieldGoals}. We can break down this last probability into the sum of ten disjoint possibilities:
{\small\begin{align*}
&P(\text{$1^{st}$ sequence OR $2^{nd}$ sequence OR ... OR $10^{th}$ sequence}) \\
&\quad = P(\text{$1^{st}$ sequence}) + P(\text{$2^{nd}$ sequence}) + \cdots + P(\text{$10^{th}$ sequence})
\end{align*}
}The probability of the first sequence was identified in Guided Practice~\ref{probOfEachSeqOfSixTriesToGetFourSuccesses} as 0.0164, and each of the other sequences have the same probability. Since each of the ten sequence has the same probability, the total probability is ten times that of any individual sequence.

The way to compute this negative binomial probability is similar to how the binomial problems were solved in Section~\ref{binomialModel}. The probability is broken into two pieces:
\begin{align*}
&P(\text{it takes Brian six tries to make four field goals}) \\
&= [\text{Number of possible sequences}] \times P(\text{Single sequence})
\end{align*}
Each part is examined separately, then we multiply to get the final result.

We first identify the probability of a single sequence. One particular case is to first observe all the failures ($n-k$ of them) followed by the $k$ successes:
\begin{align*}
&P(\text{Single sequence}) \\
&= P(\text{$n-k$ failures and then $k$ successes}) \\
&= (1-p)^{n-k} p^{k}
\end{align*}

We must also identify the number of sequences for the general case. Above, ten sequences were identified where the fourth success came on the sixth attempt. These sequences were identified by fixing the last observation as a success and looking for all the ways to arrange the other observations. In other words, how many ways could we arrange $k-1$ successes in $n-1$ trials? This can be found using the $n$ choose $k$ coefficient but for $n-1$ and $k-1$ instead:
\begin{eqnarray*}
{n-1 \choose k-1} = \frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)! \left((n-1) - (k-1)\right)!} = \frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)! \left(n - k\right)!}
\end{eqnarray*}
This is the number of different ways we can order $k-1$ successes and $n-k$ failures in $n-1$ trials. If the factorial notation (the exclamation point) is unfamiliar, see page~\pageref{factorialDefinitionInTheBinomialSection}.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Negative binomial distribution}
The negative binomial distribution describes the probability of observing the $k^{th}$ success on the $n^{th}$ trial:
\begin{eqnarray}
P(\text{the $k^{th}$ success on the $n^{th}$ trial}) = {n-1 \choose k-1} p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}
\label{negativeBinomialEquation}
\end{eqnarray}
where $p$ is the probability an individual trial is a success. All trials are assumed to be independent.}
\end{termBox}

\textC{\pagebreak}

\begin{example}{Show using Equation~\eqref{negativeBinomialEquation} that the probability Brian kicks his fourth successful field goal on the sixth attempt is 0.164.}
The probability of a single success is $p=0.8$, the number of successes is $k=4$, and the number of necessary attempts under this scenario is $n=6$.
\begin{align*}
{n-1 \choose k-1}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\ 
	=\ \frac{5!}{3!2!} (0.8)^4 (0.2)^2\ 
	=\ 10\times 0.0164\ 
	=\ 0.164
\end{align*}
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
The negative binomial distribution requires that each kick attempt by Brian is independent. Do you think it is reasonable to suggest that each of Brian's kick attempts are independent?\footnote{Answers may vary. We cannot conclusively say they are or are not independent. However, many statistical reviews of athletic performance suggests such attempts are very nearly independent.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Assume Brian's kick attempts are independent. What is the probability that Brian will kick his fourth field goal within 5 attempts?\footnote{If his fourth field goal ($k=4$) is within five attempts, it either took him four or five tries ($n=4$ or $n=5$). We have $p=0.8$ from earlier. Use Equation~\eqref{negativeBinomialEquation} to compute the probability of $n=4$ tries and $n=5$ tries, then add those probabilities together:
\begin{align*}
& P(n=4\text{ OR }n=5) = P(n=4) + P(n=5) \\
&\quad = {4-1 \choose 4-1} 0.8^4 + {5-1 \choose 4-1} (0.8)^4(1-0.8) = 1\times 0.41 + 4\times 0.082 = 0.41 + 0.33 = 0.74
\end{align*}}
\end{exercise}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Binomial versus negative binomial}
In the binomial case, we typically have a fixed number of trials and instead consider the number of successes. In the negative binomial case, we examine how many trials it takes to observe a fixed number of successes and require that the last observation be a success.}

\begin{exercise}
On 70\% of days, a hospital admits at least one heart attack patient. On 30\% of the days, no heart attack patients are admitted. Identify each case below as a binomial or negative binomial case, and compute the probability.\footnote{In each part, $p=0.7$. (a) The number of days is fixed, so this is binomial. The parameters are $k=3$ and $n=7$: 0.097. (b) The last ``success'' (admitting a heart attack patient) is fixed to the last day, so we should apply the negative binomial distribution. The parameters are $k=2$, $n=4$: 0.132. (c) This problem is negative binomial with $k=1$ and $n=5$: 0.006. Note that the negative binomial case when $k=1$ is the same as using the geometric distribution.}

(a) What is the probability the hospital will admit a heart attack patient on exactly three days this week?

(b) What is the probability the second day with a heart attack patient will be the fourth day of the week?

(c) What is the probability the fifth day of next month will be the first day with a heart attack patient?

\subsection{Poisson distribution}
\label{poisson}

\index{distribution!Poisson|(}

\begin{example}{There are about 8 million individuals in New York City. How many individuals might we expect to be hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), i.e. a heart attack, each day? According to historical records, the average number is about 4.4 individuals. However, we would also like to know the approximate distribution of counts. What would a histogram of the number of AMI occurrences each day look like if we recorded the daily counts over an entire year?} \label{amiIncidencesEachDayOver1YearInNYCExample}
A histogram of the number of occurrences of AMI on 365 days for NYC is shown in Figure~\ref{amiIncidencesOver100Days}.\footnote{These data are simulated. In practice, we should check for an association between successive days.} The sample mean (4.38) is similar to the historical average of 4.4. The sample standard deviation is about 2, and the histogram indicates that about 70\% of the data fall between 2.4 and 6.4. The distribution's shape is unimodal and skewed to the right.
\end{example}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/amiIncidencesOver100Days/amiIncidencesOver100Days}
\caption{A histogram of the number of occurrences of AMI on 365 separate days in NYC.}
\label{amiIncidencesOver100Days}
\end{figure}

The \termsub{Poisson distribution}{distribution!Poisson} is often useful for estimating the number of events in a large population over a unit of time. For instance, consider each of the following events:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item having a heart attack,
\item getting married, and
\item getting struck by lightning.
\end{itemize}
The Poisson distribution helps us describe the number of such events that will occur in a short unit of time for a fixed population if the individuals within the population are independent.

The histogram in Figure~\ref{amiIncidencesOver100Days} approximates a Poisson distribution with rate equal to 4.4. The \term{rate} for a Poisson distribution is the average number of occurrences in a mostly-fixed population per unit of time. In Example~\ref{amiIncidencesEachDayOver1YearInNYCExample}, the time unit is a day, the population is all New York City residents, and the historical rate is 4.4. The parameter in the Poisson distribution is the rate -- or how many events we expect to observe -- and it is typically denoted by $\lambda$\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-5mm}

$\lambda$\vspace{0mm}\\\footnotesize Rate for the\\Poisson dist.]{\raggedright\vspace{-5mm}

$\lambda$\vspace{0mm}\\\footnotesize Rate for the\\Poisson dist.}\index{Greek!lambda@lambda ($\lambda$)}
(the Greek letter \emph{lambda})  or $\mu$. Using the rate, we can describe the probability of observing exactly $k$ events in a single unit of time.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Poisson distribution}
Suppose we are watching for events and the number of observed events follows a Poisson distribution with rate $\lambda$. Then
\begin{align*}
P(\text{observe $k$ events}) = \frac{\lambda^{k} e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
\end{align*}
where $k$ may take a value 0, 1, 2, and so on, and $k!$ represents $k$-factorial, as described on page~\pageref{factorialDefinitionInTheBinomialSection}. The letter $e\approx2.718$ is the base of the natural logarithm. The mean and standard deviation of this distribution are $\lambda$ and $\sqrt{\lambda}$, respectively.}
\end{termBox}

We will leave a rigorous set of conditions for the Poisson distribution to a later course. However, we offer a few simple guidelines that can be used for an initial evaluation of whether the Poisson model would be appropriate.

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Is it Poisson?}
A random variable may follow a Poisson distribution if we are looking for the number of events, the population that generates such events is large, and the events occur independently of each other.}
\end{tipBox}

Even when events are not really independent -- for instance, Saturdays and Sundays are especially popular for weddings -- a Poisson model may sometimes still be reasonable if we allow it to have a different rate for different times. In the wedding example, the rate would be modeled as higher on weekends than on weekdays. The idea of modeling rates for a Poisson distribution against a second variable such as \var{dayOfTheWeek} forms the foundation of some more advanced methods that fall in the realm of \termsub{generalized linear models}{generalized linear model}. In Chapters~\ref{linRegrForTwoVar} and~\ref{multipleAndLogisticRegression}, we will discuss a foundation of linear models.

\chapter{Foundations for inference}
\label{foundationsForInference}

Statistical inference is concerned primarily with understanding the quality of parameter estimates. For example, a classic inferential question is, ``How sure are we that the estimated mean, $\bar{x}$, is near the true population mean, $\mu$?'' While the equations and details change depending on the setting, the foundations for inference are the same throughout all of statistics. We introduce these common themes in Sections~\ref{variabilityInEstimates}-\ref{cltSection} by discussing inference about the population mean, $\mu$, and set the stage for other parameters and scenarios in Section~\ref{aFrameworkForInference}. Understanding this chapter will make the rest of this book, and indeed the rest of statistics, seem much more familiar.

\label{variabilityInEstimates}

\index{point estimate|(}

We would like to estimate four features of the high schoolers in YRBSS using the sample.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[(1)] What is the average height of the YRBSS high schoolers?
\item[(2)] What is the average weight of the YRBSS high schoolers?
\item[(3)] On average, how many days per week are YRBSS high schoolers physically active?
\item[(4)] On average, how many days per week do YRBSS high schoolers do weight training?
\end{itemize}
While we focus on the mean in this chapter, questions regarding variation are often just as important in practice. For instance, if students are either very active or almost entirely inactive (the distribution is bimodal), we might try different strategies to promote a healthy lifestyle among students than if all high schoolers were already somewhat active.

% We will use $x_1, ..., x_{100}$ to represent the heights for each high schooler in our sample, and $y_1, ..., y_{100}$ will represent their weights.

\subsection{Point estimates}

\index{point estimate!single mean|(}

We want to estimate the \term{population mean} based on the sample. The most intuitive way to go about doing this is to simply take the \term{sample mean}. That is, to estimate the average height of all YRBSS students, take the average height for the sample:

\bar{x}_{height} = \frac{1.50 + 1.78 + \dots + 1.70}{100} = 1.697

The sample mean $\bar{x} = 1.697$ meters (5 feet, 6.8 inches) is called a \term{point estimate} of the population mean: if we can only choose one value to estimate the population mean, this is our best guess. Suppose we take a new sample of 100 people and recompute the mean; we will probably not get the exact same answer that we got using the \data{yrbss\_samp} data set. Estimates generally vary from one sample to another, and this \term{sampling variation} suggests our estimate may be close, but it will not be exactly equal to the parameter.

We can also estimate the average weight of YRBSS respondents by examining the sample mean of \var{weight} (in kg), and average number of days physically active in a~week:
\begin{align*}
\bar{x}_{weight} &= \frac{52.6 + 74.8 + \dots + 55.8}{100} = 68.89
&\bar{x}_{active} &= \frac{0 + 7 + \dots + 1}{100} = 3.75
\end{align*}

%library(openintro); data(yrbss.samp); d <- yrbss.samp$physically_active_7d; mean(d); d
The average weight is 68.89 kilograms, which is about 151.6 pounds.

What about generating point estimates of other \term{population parameters}, such as the population median or population standard deviation? Once again we might estimate parameters based on sample statistics, as shown in Table~\ref{ptEstimatesYrbssActive}. For example, the population standard deviation of \var{active} using the sample standard deviation, 2.56~days.

\begin{table}[h]

Suppose we want to estimate the difference in days active for men and women. If $\bar{x}_{men} = 4.3$ and $\bar{x}_{women} = 3.2$, then what would be a good point estimate for the population difference?\footnote{We could take the difference of the two sample means: $4.3 - 3.2 = 1.1$. Men are physically active about 1.1 days per week more than women on average in YRBSS.}

\index{point estimate!single mean|)}

\end{exercise}

\subsection{Point estimates are not exact}

Estimates are usually not exactly equal to the truth, but they get better as more data become available. We can see this by plotting a running mean from \data{yrbss\_samp}. A \term{running mean} is a sequence of means, where each mean uses one more observation in its calculation than the mean directly before it in the sequence. For example, the second mean in the sequence is the average of the first two observations and the third in the sequence is the average of the first three. The running mean for the \var{active} variable in the \data{yrbss\_samp} is shown in Figure~\ref{yrbssActiveRunningMean}, and it approaches the true population average, 3.90~days, as more data become available.

\begin{figure}[h]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.72\textwidth]{ch_inference_foundations/figures/yrbssActiveRunningMean/yrbssActiveRunningMean}
   \caption{The mean computed after adding each individual to the sample. The mean tends to approach the true population average as more data become available.}
   \label{yrbssActiveRunningMean}
\end{figure}

Sample point estimates only approximate the population parameter, and they vary from one sample to another. If we took another simple random sample of the YRBSS students, we would find that the sample mean for the number of days active would be a little different. It will be useful to quantify how variable an estimate is from one sample to another. If this variability is small (i.e. the sample mean doesn't change much from one sample to another) then that estimate is probably very accurate. If it varies widely from one sample to another, then we should not expect our estimate to be very good.


\subsection{Standard error of the mean}
\label{seOfTheMean}

From the random sample represented in \data{yrbss\_samp}, we guessed the average number of days a YRBSS student is physically active is 3.75~days. Suppose we take another random sample of 100 individuals and take its mean: 3.22~days. Suppose we took another (3.67~days) and another (4.10~days), and so on. If we do this many many times -- which we can do only because we have all YRBSS students -- we can build up a \term{sampling distribution} for the sample mean when the sample size is 100, shown in Figure~\ref{yrbssActive1000SampDist}.

\begin{figure}[h]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ch_inference_foundations/figures/yrbssActive1000SampDist/yrbssActive1000SampDist}
   \caption{A histogram of 1000 sample means for number of days physically active per week, where the samples are of size $n=100$.}
   \label{yrbssActive1000SampDist}
\end{figure}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Sampling distribution}
The sampling distribution represents the distribution of the point estimates based on samples of a fixed size from a certain population. It is useful to think of a particular point estimate as being drawn from such a distribution. Understanding the concept of a sampling distribution is central to understanding statistical inference.}
\end{termBox}

The sampling distribution shown in Figure~\ref{yrbssActive1000SampDist} is unimodal and approximately symmetric. It is also centered exactly at the true population mean: $\mu=3.90$. Intuitively, this makes sense. The sample means should tend to ``fall around'' the population mean.

We can see that the sample mean has some variability around the population mean, which can be quantified using the standard deviation of this distribution of sample means: $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = 0.26$. The standard deviation of the sample mean tells us how far the typical estimate is away from the actual population mean, 3.90~days. It also describes the typical \term{error} of the point estimate, and for this reason we usually call this standard deviation the \term{standard error (SE)}\index{SE}\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-4mm}

$SE$\\\footnotesize standard\\error]{\raggedright\vspace{-4mm}

$SE$\\\footnotesize standard\\error} of the estimate.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Standard error of an estimate}
The standard deviation associated with an estimate is called the \emph{standard error}. It describes the typical error or uncertainty associated with the estimate.}
\end{termBox}

When considering the case of the point estimate $\bar{x}$, there is one problem: there is no obvious way to estimate its standard error from a single sample. However, statistical theory provides a helpful tool to address this issue. 

\textC{\newpage}

\begin{exercise}
(a) Would you rather use a small sample or a large sample when estimating a parameter? Why? (b) Using your reasoning from (a), would you expect a point estimate based on a small sample to have smaller or larger standard error than a point estimate based on a larger sample?\footnote{(a) Consider two random samples: one of size 10 and one of size 1000. Individual observations in the small sample are highly influential on the estimate while in larger samples these individual observations would more often average each other out. The larger sample would tend to provide a more accurate estimate. (b) If we think an estimate is better, we probably mean it typically has less error. Based on (a), our intuition suggests that a larger sample size corresponds to a smaller standard error.}
\end{exercise}

In the sample of 100 students, the standard error of the sample mean is equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size:
\begin{eqnarray*}
SE_{\bar{x}} = \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma_{x}}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{2.6}{\sqrt{100}} = 0.26
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\sigma_{x}$ is the standard deviation of the individual observations. This is no coincidence. We can show mathematically that this equation is correct when the observations are independent using the probability tools of Section~\ref{randomVariablesSection}.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Computing SE for the sample mean}
Given $n$ independent observations from a population with standard deviation $\sigma$, the standard error of the sample mean is equal to \vspace{-1mm}
\begin{eqnarray}
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\label{seOfXBar}
\end{eqnarray}\vspace{-3mm}%

A reliable method to ensure sample observations are independent is to conduct a simple random sample consisting of less than 10\% of the population.\index{standard error (SE)!single mean}
}
\end{termBox}

There is one subtle issue in Equation~(\ref{seOfXBar}): the population standard deviation is typically unknown. You might have already guessed how to resolve this problem: we can use the point estimate of the standard deviation from the sample. This estimate tends to be sufficiently good when the sample size is at least 30 and the population distribution is not strongly skewed%\footnote{Some books suggest 30 is sufficient; we take a slightly more conservative approach.}
% x <- c(); for(i in 1:10000){ x[i] <- mean(exp(rnorm(30, sd=0.5))) }; hist(x); (quantile(x, c(0.025, 0.975)) - mean(x)) / sd(x)
% M <- mean(x); x <- rep(NA, 1000); for(i in 1:1000){ temp <- exp(rnorm(30, sd=0.5)); x[i] <- (max(temp) - M) / sd(temp) }; hist(x); quantile(x, 0.95)
% for(i in 1:1000){ temp <- exp(rnorm(30, sd=0.5)); hist(temp, breaks=seq(0, 12, 0.5), main=round((max(temp) - mean(temp))/sd(temp), 1)); Sys.sleep(0.5) }
. Thus, we often just use the sample standard deviation $s$ instead of~$\sigma$. When the sample size is smaller than 30, we will need to use a method to account for extra uncertainty in the standard error. If the skew condition is not met, a larger sample is needed to compensate for the extra skew. These topics are further discussed in Section~\ref{cltSection}.

\begin{exercise}
In the sample of 100 students, the standard deviation of student heights is $s_{height} = 0.088$ meters. In this case, we can confirm that the observations are independent by checking that the data come from a simple random sample consisting of less than 10\% of the population. (a)~What is the standard error of the sample mean, $\bar{x}_{height} = 1.70$ meters? (b)~Would you be surprised if someone told you the average height of all YRBSS respondents was actually 1.69~meters?\footnote{(a) Use Equation~(\ref{seOfXBar}) with the sample standard deviation to compute the standard error: $SE_{\bar{y}} = 0.088 / \sqrt{100} = 0.0088$ meters. (b) It would not be surprising. Our sample is about 1 standard error from 1.69m. In other words, 1.69m does not seem to be implausible given that our sample was relatively close to it. (We use the standard error to identify what is close.)}
\end{exercise}
%library(openintro); library(xtable); data(yrbss); data(yrbss.samp); d <- yrbss.samp$height; mean(d); sd(d); mean(yrbss$height, na.rm=TRUE); sd(yrbss$height, na.rm=TRUE)

\textC{\pagebreak}

\begin{exercise}
(a) Would you be more trusting of a sample that has 100 observations or 400 observations? (b) We want to show mathematically that our estimate tends to be better when the sample size is larger. If the standard deviation of the individual observations is 10, what is our estimate of the standard error when the sample size is 100? What about when it is 400? (c) Explain how your answer to part~(b) mathematically justifies your intuition in part~(a).\footnote{(a) Extra observations are usually helpful in understanding the population, so a point estimate with 400 observations seems more trustworthy. (b) The standard error when the sample size is 100 is given by $SE_{100} = 10/\sqrt{100} = 1$. For 400: $SE_{400} = 10/\sqrt{400} = 0.5$. The larger sample has a smaller standard error. (c) The standard error of the sample with 400 observations is lower than that of the sample with 100 observations. The standard error describes the typical error, and since it is lower for the larger sample, this mathematically shows the estimate from the larger sample tends to be better -- though it does not guarantee that every large sample will provide a better estimate than a particular small sample.}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Basic properties of point estimates}

We achieved three goals in this section. First, we determined that point estimates from a sample may be used to estimate population parameters. We also determined that these point estimates are not exact: they vary from one sample to another. Lastly, we quantified the uncertainty of the sample mean using what we call the standard error, mathematically represented in Equation~\eqref{seOfXBar}. While we could also quantify the standard error for other estimates -- such as the median, standard deviation, or any other number of statistics -- we will postpone these extensions until later chapters or courses.

\label{confidenceIntervals}

\index{confidence interval|(}

A point estimate provides a single plausible value for a parameter. However, a point estimate is rarely perfect; usually there is some error in the estimate. Instead of supplying just a point estimate of a parameter, a next logical step would be to provide a plausible \emph{range of values} for the parameter.

% In this section and in Section~\ref{hypothesisTesting}, we will emphasize the special case where the point estimate is a sample mean and the parameter is the population mean. In Section~\ref{aFrameworkForInference}, we generalize these methods for a variety of point estimates and population parameters that we will encounter in Chapter~\ref{inferenceForNumericalData} and beyond.

\subsection{Capturing the population parameter}

A plausible range of values for the population parameter is called a \term{confidence interval}.

Using only a point estimate is like fishing in a murky lake with a spear, and using a confidence interval is like fishing with a net. We can throw a spear where we saw a fish, but we will probably miss. On the other hand, if we toss a net in that area, we have a good chance of catching the fish.

If we report a point estimate, we probably will not hit the exact population parameter. On the other hand, if we report a range of plausible values -- a confidence interval -- we have a good shot at capturing the parameter. 

\begin{exercise}
If we want to be very certain we capture the population parameter, should we use a wider interval or a smaller interval?\footnote{If we want to be more certain we will capture the fish, we might use a wider net. Likewise, we use a wider confidence interval if we want to be more certain that we capture the parameter.}
\end{exercise}


\textC{\pagebreak}


\subsection{An approximate 95\% confidence interval}

Our point estimate is the most plausible value of the parameter, so it makes sense to build the confidence interval around the point estimate. The standard error, which is a measure of the uncertainty associated with the point estimate, provides a guide for how large we should make the confidence interval.

The standard error represents the standard deviation associated with the estimate, and roughly 95\% of the time the estimate will be within 2 standard errors of the parameter. If~the interval spreads out 2 standard errors from the point estimate, we can be roughly 95\% \term{confident} that we have captured the true parameter:
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{point estimate}\ \pm\ 2\times SE
\label{95PercentConfidenceIntervalFormula}
\end{eqnarray}
But what does ``95\% confident'' mean? Suppose we took many samples and built a confidence interval from each sample using Equation~(\ref{95PercentConfidenceIntervalFormula}). Then about 95\% of those intervals would contain the actual mean, $\mu$. Figure~\ref{95PercentConfidenceInterval} shows this process with 25 samples, where 24 of the resulting confidence intervals contain the average number of days per week that YRBSS students are physically active, $\mu=3.90$~days, and one interval does not.

\begin{figure}[hht]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.78\textwidth]{ch_inference_foundations/figures/95PercentConfidenceInterval/95PercentConfidenceInterval}
   \caption{Twenty-five samples of size $n=100$ were taken from \data{yrbss}. For~each sample, a confidence interval was created to try to capture the average number of days per week that students are physically active. Only~1 of these~25 intervals did not capture the true mean, $\mu = 3.90$~days.}
   \label{95PercentConfidenceInterval}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
In Figure~\ref{95PercentConfidenceInterval}, one interval does not contain 3.90 minutes. Does this imply that the mean cannot be 3.90?\footnote{Just as some observations occur more than 2 standard deviations from the mean, some point estimates will be more than 2 standard errors from the parameter. A confidence interval only provides a plausible range of values for a parameter. While we might say other values are implausible based on the data, this does not mean they are impossible.}
\end{exercise}

The rule where about 95\% of observations are within 2 standard deviations of the mean is only approximately true. However, it holds very well for the normal distribution. As we will soon see, the mean tends to be normally distributed when the sample size is sufficiently large. 

\begin{example}{The sample mean of days active per week from \data{yrbss\_samp} is 3.75~days. The standard error, as estimated using the sample standard deviation, is $SE=\frac{2.6}{\sqrt{100}} = 0.26$~days. (The population SD is unknown in most applications, so we use the sample SD here.) Calculate an approximate 95\% confidence interval for the average days active per week for all YRBSS students.}
We apply Equation~(\ref{95PercentConfidenceIntervalFormula}):
\begin{eqnarray*}
3.75\ \pm\ 2 \times  0.26 \quad \rightarrow \quad (3.23, 4.27)
\end{eqnarray*}
Based on these data, we are about 95\% confident that the average days active per week for all YRBSS students was larger than 3.23 but less than 4.27~days. Our~interval extends out 2 standard errors from the point estimate, $\bar{x}_{active}$.
\end{example}
% library(openintro); library(xtable); d <- yrbss.samp; mean(d$physically_active_7d); sd(d$physically_active_7d); sd(yrbss$physically_active_7d, na.rm=TRUE)

\begin{exercise} \label{95CIExerciseForAgeOfYrbssSamp1}
The sample data suggest the average YRBSS student height is $\bar{x}_{height} = 1.697$ meters with a standard error of 0.0088 meters (estimated using the sample standard deviation, 0.088 meters). What is an approximate 95\% confidence interval for the average height of all of the YRBSS students?\footnote{Apply Equation~(\ref{95PercentConfidenceIntervalFormula}): $1.697 \ \pm \ 2\times 0.0088 \rightarrow (1.6794, 1.7146)$. We interpret this interval as follows: We are about 95\% confident the average height of all YRBSS students was between 1.6794 and 1.7146 meters (5.51~to 5.62~feet).}
\end{exercise}
% library(openintro); d <- yrbss.samp; mean(d$height); sd(d$height)

\subsection{The sampling distribution for the mean}

In Section~\ref{seOfTheMean}, we introduced a sampling distribution for $\bar{x}$, the average days physically active per week for samples of size 100. We examined this distribution earlier in Figure~\ref{yrbssActive1000SampDist}. Now we'll take 100,000 samples, calculate the mean of each, and plot them in a histogram to get an especially accurate depiction of the sampling distribution. This histogram is shown in the left panel of Figure~\ref{yrbssActiveBigSampDist}.

\begin{figure}[hht]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_inference_foundations/figures/yrbssActiveBigSampDist/yrbssActiveBigSampDist}
   \caption{The left panel shows a histogram of the sample means for 100,000 different random samples. The right panel shows a normal probability plot of those sample means.}
   \label{yrbssActiveBigSampDist}
\end{figure}

Does this distribution look familiar? Hopefully so! The distribution of sample means closely resembles the normal distribution (see Section~\ref{normalDist}). A normal probability plot of these sample means is shown in the right panel of Figure~\ref{yrbssActiveBigSampDist}. Because all of the points closely fall around a straight line, we can conclude the distribution of sample means is nearly normal. This result can be explained by the Central Limit Theorem.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Central Limit Theorem, informal description}
If a sample consists of at least 30 independent observations and the data are not strongly skewed, then the distribution of the sample mean is well approximated by a~normal model.\index{Central Limit Theorem}}
\end{termBox}

We will apply this informal version of the Central Limit Theorem for now, and discuss its details further in Section~\ref{cltSection}.

The choice of using 2 standard errors in Equation~(\ref{95PercentConfidenceIntervalFormula}) was based on our general guideline that roughly 95\% of the time, observations are within two standard deviations of the mean. Under the normal model, we can make this more accurate by using 1.96 in place~of~2.
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{point estimate}\ \pm\ 1.96\times SE
\label{95PercentCIWhenUsingNormalModel}
\end{eqnarray}
If a point estimate, such as $\bar{x}$, is associated with a normal model and standard error $SE$, then we use this more precise 95\% confidence interval.


\subsection{Changing the confidence level}
\label{changingTheConfidenceLevelSection}

\index{confidence interval!confidence level|(}

Suppose we want to consider confidence intervals where the confidence level is somewhat higher than 95\%; perhaps we would like a confidence level of 99\%. Think back to the analogy about trying to catch a fish: if we want to be more sure that we will catch the fish, we should use a wider net. To create a 99\% confidence level, we must also widen our 95\% interval. On the other hand, if we want an interval with lower confidence, such as 90\%, we could make our original 95\% interval slightly slimmer.

The 95\% confidence interval structure provides guidance in how to make intervals with new confidence levels. Below is a general 95\% confidence interval for a point estimate that comes from a nearly normal distribution:
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{point estimate}\ \pm\ 1.96\times SE
\end{eqnarray}
There are three components to this interval: the point estimate, ``1.96'', and the standard error. The choice of $1.96\times SE$ was based on capturing 95\% of the data since the estimate is within 1.96 standard deviations of the parameter about 95\% of the time. The choice of 1.96 corresponds to a 95\% confidence level. 

\begin{exercise} \label{leadInForMakingA99PercentCIExercise}
If $X$ is a normally distributed random variable, how often will $X$ be within 2.58 standard deviations of the mean?\footnote{This is equivalent to asking how often the Z-score will be larger than -2.58 but less than 2.58. (For a picture, see Figure~\ref{choosingZForCI}.) To determine this probability, look up -2.58 and 2.58 in the normal probability table (0.0049 and 0.9951). Thus, there is a $0.9951-0.0049 \approx 0.99$ probability that the unobserved random variable $X$ will be within 2.58 standard deviations of $\mu$.}
\end{exercise}

To create a 99\% confidence interval, change 1.96 in the 95\% confidence interval formula to be $2.58$. Guided Practice~\ref{leadInForMakingA99PercentCIExercise} highlights that 99\% of the time a normal random variable will be within 2.58 standard deviations of the mean. This approach -- using the Z-scores in the normal model to compute confidence levels -- is appropriate when $\bar{x}$ is associated with a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $SE_{\bar{x}}$. Thus, the formula for a 99\% confidence interval is
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{x}\ \pm\ 2.58\times SE_{\bar{x}}
\label{99PercCIForMean}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_inference_foundations/figures/choosingZForCI/choosingZForCI}
\caption{The area between -$z^{\star}$ and $z^{\star}$ increases as $|z^{\star}|$ becomes larger. If the confidence level is 99\%, we choose $z^{\star}$ such that 99\% of the normal curve is between -$z^{\star}$ and $z^{\star}$, which corresponds to 0.5\% in the lower tail and 0.5\% in the upper tail: $z^{\star}=2.58$.}
\label{choosingZForCI}
\index{confidence interval!confidence level|)}
\end{figure}

The normal approximation is crucial to the precision of these confidence intervals. Section~\ref{cltSection} provides a more detailed discussion about when the normal model can safely be applied. When the normal model is not a good fit, we will use alternative distributions that better characterize the sampling distribution.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Conditions for $\bar{x}$ being nearly normal and $SE$ being accurate\label{terBoxOfCondForXBarBeingNearlyNormalAndSEBeingAccurate}}
Important conditions to help ensure the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ is nearly normal and the estimate of SE sufficiently accurate:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item The sample observations are independent.
\item The sample size is large: $n\geq30$ is a good rule of thumb.
\item The population distribution is not strongly skewed. This condition can be difficult to evaluate, so just use your best judgement.
\end{itemize}
Additionally, the larger the sample size, the more lenient we can be with the sample's skew.}
\end{termBox}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle[]{How to verify sample observations are independent}
If the observations are from a simple random sample and consist of fewer than 10\% of the population, then they are independent.\\[2mm]
Subjects in an experiment are considered independent if they undergo random assignment to the treatment groups. \\[2mm]
If a sample is from a seemingly random process, e.g. the lifetimes of wrenches used in a particular manufacturing process, checking independence is more difficult. In~this case, use your best judgement.}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle[]{Checking for strong skew usually means checking for obvious outliers}
When there are prominent outliers present, the sample should contain at least 100 observations, and in some cases, much more. \\[2mm]
This is a first course in statistics, so you won't have perfect judgement on assessing skew. That's okay. If you're in a bind, either consult a statistician or learn about the studentized bootstrap (bootstrap-t) method.}

\begin{exercise} \label{find90CIForYrbssAgeExercise}
Use the data in Guided Practice~\ref{find99CIForYrbssAgeExercise} to create a 90\% confidence interval for the average days active per week of all YRBSS students.\footnote{We first find $z^{\star}$ such that 90\% of the distribution falls between -$z^{\star}$ and $z^{\star}$ in the standard normal model, $N(\mu=0, \sigma=1)$. We can look up -$z^{\star}$ in the normal probability table by looking for a lower tail of 5\% (the other 5\% is in the upper tail): $z^{\star}=1.65$. The 90\% confidence interval can then be computed as $\bar{x}_{active}\ \pm\ 1.65\times SE_{\bar{x}} \to (3.32, 4.18)$. (We had already verified conditions for normality and the standard error.) That is, we are 90\% confident the average days active per week is between 3.32 and 4.18~days.}

\subsection{Interpreting confidence intervals}
\label{interpretingCIs}

\index{confidence interval!interpretation|(}

A careful eye might have observed the somewhat awkward language used to describe confidence intervals. Correct interpretation:
\begin{quote}
We are XX\% confident that the population parameter is between...
\end{quote}
\emph{Incorrect} language might try to describe the confidence interval as capturing the population parameter with a certain probability. This is a common error: while it might be useful to think of it as a probability, the confidence level only quantifies how plausible it is that the parameter is in the interval.

Another important consideration of confidence intervals is that they \emph{only try to capture the population parameter}. A confidence interval says nothing about the confidence of capturing individual observations, a proportion of the observations, or about capturing point estimates. Confidence intervals only attempt to capture population parameters.

\index{hypothesis testing|(}

Are students lifting weights or performing other strength training exercises more or less often than they have in the past? We'll compare data from students from the 2011 YRBSS survey to our sample of 100 students from the 2013 YRBSS survey.

We'll also consider sleep behavior. A recent study found that college students average about 7~hours of sleep per night.\footnote{\oiRedirect{textbook-theloquitur_1161}{\emph{Poll shows college students get least amount of sleep}. theloquitur.com/?p=1161}} However, researchers at a rural college are interested in showing that their students sleep longer than seven hours on average. We investigate this topic in Section~\ref{pValue}.

\subsection{Hypothesis testing framework}

Students from the 2011 YRBSS lifted weights (or performed other strength training exercises) 3.09~days per week on average. We want to determine if the \data{yrbss\_samp} data set provides strong evidence that YRBSS students selected in 2013 are lifting more or less than the 2011 YRBSS students, versus the other possibility that there has been no change.\footnote{While we could answer this question by examining the entire YRBSS data set from 2013 (\data{yrbss}), we only consider the sample data (\data{yrbss\_samp}), which is more realistic since we rarely have access to population data.} We simplify these three options into two competing \termsub{hypotheses}{hypothesis}:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] The average days per week that YRBSS students lifted weights was the same for 2011 and~2013.
\item[$H_A$:] The average days per week that YRBSS students lifted weights was \emph{different} for 2013 than~in~2011.
\end{itemize}
We call $H_0$\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{6mm}

$H_0$\\\footnotesize null hypothesis\vspace{3mm}\\\normalsize $H_A$\\\footnotesize alternative\\ hypothesis]{\raggedright\vspace{6mm}

$H_0$\\\footnotesize null hypothesis\vspace{3mm}\\\normalsize $H_A$\\\footnotesize alternative\\ hypothesis} the null hypothesis and $H_A$ the alternative hypothesis.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Null and alternative hypotheses}
{\small The \term{null hypothesis ($H_0$)} often represents either a skeptical perspective or a claim to be tested. The \term{alternative hypothesis ($H_A$)} represents an alternative claim under consideration and is often represented by a range of possible parameter values.}}
\end{termBox}

The null hypothesis often represents a skeptical position or a perspective of no difference. The alternative hypothesis often represents a new perspective, such as the possibility that there has been a change. 

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Hypothesis testing framework}
The skeptic will not reject the null hypothesis ($H_0$), unless the evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis ($H_A$) is so strong that she rejects $H_0$ in favor of $H_A$.}
\end{tipBox}

The hypothesis testing framework is a very general tool, and we often use it without a second thought. If a person makes a somewhat unbelievable claim, we are initially skeptical. However, if there is sufficient evidence that supports the claim, we set aside our skepticism and reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. The hallmarks of hypothesis testing are also found in the US court system. 

\begin{exercise} \label{hypTestCourtExample}
A US court considers two possible claims about a defendant: she is either innocent or guilty. If we set these claims up in a hypothesis framework, which would be the null hypothesis and which the alternative?\footnote{The jury considers whether the evidence is so convincing (strong) that there is no reasonable doubt regarding the person's guilt; in such a case, the jury rejects innocence (the null hypothesis) and concludes the defendant is guilty (alternative hypothesis).}
\end{exercise}

Jurors examine the evidence to see whether it convincingly shows a defendant is guilty. Even if the jurors leave unconvinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, this does not mean they believe the defendant is innocent. This is also the case with hypothesis testing: \emph{even if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we typically do not accept the null hypothesis as true}. Failing to find strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis is not equivalent to accepting the null hypothesis.

In the example with the YRBSS, the null hypothesis represents no difference in the average days per week of weight lifting in 2011 and 2013. The alternative hypothesis represents something new or more interesting: there was a difference, either an increase or a decrease. These hypotheses can be described in mathematical notation using $\mu_{13}$ as the average days of weight lifting for 2013:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] $\mu_{13} = 3.09$
\item[$H_A$:] $\mu_{13} \neq 3.09$
\end{itemize}
where 3.09 is the average number of days per week that students from the 2011 YRBSS lifted weights. Using the mathematical notation, the hypotheses can more easily be evaluated using statistical tools. We call 3.09 the \term{null value} since it represents the value of the parameter if the null hypothesis is true.


\subsection{Testing hypotheses using confidence intervals}
\label{utilizingOurCI}

We will use the \data{yrbss\_samp} data set to evaluate the hypothesis test, and we start by comparing the 2013 point estimate of the number of days per week that students lifted weights: $\bar{x}_{13} = 2.78$~days. This estimate suggests that students from the 2013 YRBSS were lifting weights less than students in the 2011 YRBSS. However, to evaluate whether this provides strong evidence that there has been a change, we must consider the uncertainty associated with $\bar{x}_{13}$.

We learned in Section~\ref{variabilityInEstimates} that there is fluctuation from one sample to another, and it is unlikely that the sample mean will be exactly equal to the parameter; we should not expect $\bar{x}_{13}$ to exactly equal $\mu_{13}$. Given that $\bar{x}_{13} = 2.78$, it might still be possible that the average of all students from the 2013 YRBSS survey is the same as the average from the 2011 YRBSS survey. The difference between $\bar{x}_{13}$ and 3.09 could be due to \emph{sampling variation}, i.e. the variability associated with the point estimate when we take a random sample.

In Section~\ref{confidenceIntervals}, confidence intervals were introduced as a way to find a range of plausible values for the population mean.

\begin{example}{In the sample of 100 students from the 2013 YRBSS survey, the average number of days per week that students lifted weights was 2.78~days with a standard deviation of 2.56 days (coincidentally the same as days active). Compute a 95\% confidence interval for the average for all students from the 2013 YRBSS survey. You can assume the conditions for the normal model are met.}
The general formula for the confidence interval based on the normal distribution is
\begin{align*}
\bar{x} \pm z^{\star} SE_{\bar{x}}
\end{align*}
We are given $\bar{x}_{13} = 2.78$, we use $z^{\star} = 1.96$ for a 95\% confidence level, and we can compute the standard error using the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size:
\begin{align*}
SE_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s_{13}}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{2.56}{\sqrt{100}} = 0.256
\end{align*}
Entering the sample mean, $z^{\star}$, and the standard error into the confidence interval formula results in (2.27, 3.29). We are 95\% confident that the average number of days per week that all students from the 2013 YRBSS lifted weights was between 2.27~and 3.29~days.
\end{example}

Because the average of all students from the 2011 YRBSS survey is 3.09, which falls within the range of plausible values from the confidence interval, we cannot say the null hypothesis is implausible. That is, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, $H_0$.

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Double negatives can sometimes be used in statistics}
In many statistical explanations, we use double negatives. For instance, we might say that the null hypothesis is \emph{not implausible} or we \emph{failed to reject} the null hypothesis. Double negatives are used to communicate that while we are not rejecting a position, we are also not saying it is correct.}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{exercise} \label{htForHousingExpenseForCommunityCollege650}
Colleges frequently provide estimates of student expenses such as housing. A consultant hired by a community college claimed that the average student housing expense was \$650 per month. What are the null and alternative hypotheses to test whether this claim is accurate?\footnote{$H_0$: The average cost is \$650 per month, $\mu = \$650$.

\hspace{3.4mm}$H_A$: The average cost is different than \$650 per month, $\mu \neq \$650$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{normalDistCondForHousingExpenseForCommunityCollege650}
The community college decides to collect data to evaluate the \$650 per month claim. They take a random sample of 175 students at their school and obtain the data represented in Figure~\ref{communityCollegeClaimedHousingExpenseDistribution}. Can we apply the normal model to the sample mean?\footnote{Applying the normal model requires that certain conditions are met. Because the data are a simple random sample and the sample (presumably) represents no more than 10\% of all students at the college, the observations are independent. The sample size is also sufficiently large ($n = 175$) and the data exhibit strong skew. While the data are strongly skewed, the sample is sufficiently large that this is acceptable, and the normal model may be applied to the sample mean.}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ch_inference_foundations/figures/communityCollegeClaimedHousingExpenseDistribution/communityCollegeClaimedHousingExpenseDistribution}
\caption{Sample distribution of student housing expense. These data are strongly skewed\index{skew!example: strong}, which we can see by the long right tail with a few notable outliers.}
\label{communityCollegeClaimedHousingExpenseDistribution}
\end{figure}
\end{exercise}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle[]{Evaluating the skew condition is challenging}
Don't despair if checking the skew condition is difficult or confusing. You aren't alone -- nearly all students get frustrated when checking skew. Properly assessing skew takes practice, and you won't be a pro, even at the end of this book. \\[2mm]
But this doesn't mean you should give up. Checking skew and the other conditions is extremely important for a responsible data analysis. However, rest assured that evaluating skew isn't something you need to be a master of by the end of the book, though by that time you should be able to properly assess clear cut cases.}
\end{tipBox}

\textC{\newpage}

\begin{example}{The sample mean for student housing is \$616.91 and the sample standard deviation is \$128.65. Construct a 95\% confidence interval for the population mean and evaluate the hypotheses of Guided Practice~\ref{htForHousingExpenseForCommunityCollege650}.}
The standard error associated with the mean may be estimated using the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. Recall that $n = 175$ students were sampled.
\begin{align*}
SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{128.65}{\sqrt{175}} = 9.73
\end{align*}
You showed in Guided Practice~\ref{normalDistCondForHousingExpenseForCommunityCollege650} that the normal model may be applied to the sample mean. This ensures a 95\% confidence interval may be accurately constructed:
$$\bar{x}\ \pm\ z^{\star} SE \quad\to\quad 616.91\ \pm\ 1.96 \times 9.73 \quad \to \quad (597.84, 635.98) $$
Because the null value \$650 is not in the confidence interval, a true mean of \$650 is implausible and we reject the null hypothesis. The data provide statistically significant evidence that the actual average housing expense is less than \$650 per month.
\end{example}


\subsection{Decision errors}

\index{hypothesis testing!decision errors|(}

Hypothesis tests are not flawless, since we can make a wrong decision in statistical hypothesis tests based on the data. For example, in the court system innocent people are sometimes wrongly convicted and the guilty sometimes walk free. However, the difference is that in statistical hypothesis tests, we have the tools necessary to quantify how often we make such errors.

% Hypothesis tests are not flawless. Just think of the court system: innocent people are sometimes wrongly convicted and the guilty sometimes walk free. Similarly, we can make a wrong decision in statistical hypothesis tests. However, the difference is that we have the tools necessary to quantify how often we make such errors.

There are two competing hypotheses: the null and the alternative. In a hypothesis test, we make a statement about which one might be true, but we might choose incorrectly. There are four possible scenarios, which are summarized in Table~\ref{fourHTScenarios}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l l c c}
& & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Test conclusion}} \\
  \cline{3-4}
\vspace{-3.7mm} \\
& & do not reject $H_0$ &  reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_A$ \\
  \cline{2-4}
\vspace{-3.7mm} \\
& $H_0$ true & okay &  Type~1 Error \\
\raisebox{1.5ex}{\textbf{Truth}} & $H_A$ true & Type~2 Error & okay \\
  \cline{2-4}
\end{tabular}
\caption{Four different scenarios for hypothesis tests.}
\label{fourHTScenarios}
\end{table}

A \term{Type~1 Error} is rejecting the null hypothesis when $H_0$ is actually true. A \term{Type~2 Error} is failing to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative is actually true.

\begin{exercise} \label{whatAreTheErrorTypesInUSCourts}
In a US court, the defendant is either innocent ($H_0$) or  guilty ($H_A$). What does a Type~1 Error represent in this context? What does a Type~2 Error represent? Table~\ref{fourHTScenarios} may be useful.\footnote{If the court makes a Type~1 Error, this means the defendant is innocent ($H_0$ true) but wrongly convicted. A Type~2 Error means the court failed to reject $H_0$ (i.e. failed to convict the person) when she was in fact guilty ($H_A$ true).}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{howToReduceType1ErrorsInUSCourts}
How could we reduce the Type~1 Error rate in US courts? What influence would this have on the Type~2 Error rate?\footnote{To lower the Type~1 Error rate, we might raise our standard for conviction from ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' to ``beyond a conceivable doubt'' so fewer people would be wrongly convicted. However, this would also make it more difficult to convict the people who are actually guilty, so we would make more Type~2 Errors.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{howToReduceType2ErrorsInUSCourts}
How could we reduce the Type~2 Error rate in US courts? What influence would this have on the Type~1 Error rate?\footnote{To lower the Type~2 Error rate, we want to convict more guilty people. We could lower the standards for conviction from ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' to ``beyond a little doubt''. Lowering the bar for guilt will also result in more wrongful convictions, raising the Type~1 Error rate.}
\end{exercise}

\index{hypothesis testing!decision errors|)}

Exercises~\ref{whatAreTheErrorTypesInUSCourts}-\ref{howToReduceType2ErrorsInUSCourts} provide an important lesson: if we reduce how often we make one type of error, we generally make more of the other type.

Hypothesis testing is built around rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis. That is, we do not reject $H_0$ unless we have strong evidence. But what precisely does \emph{strong evidence} mean? As a general rule of thumb, for those cases where the null hypothesis is actually true, we do not want to incorrectly reject $H_0$ more than 5\% of the time. This corresponds to a \term{significance level}\index{hypothesis testing!significance level} of 0.05. We often write the significance level using $\alpha$\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-4mm}

$\alpha$\\\footnotesize significance\\level of a\\hypothesis test]{\raggedright\vspace{-4mm}

$\alpha$\\\footnotesize significance\\level of a\\hypothesis test} (the Greek letter \emph{alpha}\index{Greek!alpha@alpha ($\alpha$)}): $\alpha = 0.05$. We discuss the appropriateness of different significance levels in Section~\ref{significanceLevel}.

If we use a 95\% confidence interval to evaluate a hypothesis test where the null hypothesis is true, we will make an error whenever the point estimate is at least 1.96 standard errors away from the population parameter. This happens about 5\% of the time (2.5\% in each tail). Similarly, using a 99\% confidence interval to evaluate a hypothesis is equivalent to a significance level of $\alpha = 0.01$.

A confidence interval is, in one sense, simplistic in the world of hypothesis tests. Consider the following two scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item The null value (the parameter value under the null hypothesis) is in the 95\% confidence interval but just barely, so we would not reject $H_0$. However, we might like to somehow say, quantitatively, that it was a close decision.
\item The null value is very far outside of the interval, so we reject $H_0$. However, we want to communicate that, not only did we reject the null hypothesis, but it wasn't even close. Such a case is depicted in Figure~\ref{whyWeWantPValue}.
\end{itemize}
In Section~\ref{pValue}, we introduce a tool called the \emph{p-value} that will be helpful in these cases. The p-value method also extends to hypothesis tests where confidence intervals cannot be easily constructed or applied.

\begin{figure}[hht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{ch_inference_foundations/figures/whyWeWantPValue/whyWeWantPValue}
\caption{It would be helpful to quantify the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis. In this case, the evidence is extremely strong.}
\label{whyWeWantPValue}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Formal testing using p-values}
\label{pValue}

\index{hypothesis testing!p-value|(}

The p-value is a way of quantifying the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis and in favor of the alternative. Formally the \emph{p-value} is a conditional probability.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{p-value}
The \term{p-value}\index{hypothesis testing!p-value|textbf} is the probability of observing data at least as favorable to the alternative hypothesis as our current data set, if the null hypothesis is true. We typically use a summary statistic of the data, in this chapter the sample mean, to help compute the p-value and evaluate the hypotheses.}
\end{termBox}

\index{data!school sleep|(}


\begin{exercise} \label{skepticalPerspOfRuralSchoolSleepExercise}
A poll by the National Sleep Foundation found that college students average about 7 hours of sleep per night. Researchers at a rural school are interested in showing that students at their school sleep longer than seven hours on average, and they would like to demonstrate this using a sample of students. What would be an appropriate skeptical position for this research?\footnote{A skeptic would have no reason to believe that sleep patterns at this school are different than the sleep patterns at another school.}
\end{exercise}

We can set up the null hypothesis for this test as a skeptical perspective: the students at this school average 7 hours of sleep per night. The alternative hypothesis takes a new form reflecting the interests of the research: the students average more than 7 hours of sleep. We can write these hypotheses as
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] $\mu = 7$.
\item[$H_A$:] $\mu > 7$.
\end{itemize}
Using $\mu > 7$ as the alternative is an example of a \term{one-sided} hypothesis test. In this investigation, there is no apparent interest in learning whether the mean is less than 7~hours.\footnote{This is entirely based on the interests of the researchers. Had they been only interested in the opposite case -- showing that their students were actually averaging fewer than seven hours of sleep but not interested in showing more than 7 hours -- then our setup would have set the alternative as $\mu < 7$.} Earlier we encountered a \term{two-sided} hypothesis where we looked for any clear difference, greater than or less than the null value.

Always use a two-sided test unless it was made clear prior to data collection that the test should be one-sided. Switching a two-sided test to a one-sided test after observing the data is dangerous because it can inflate the Type~1 Error rate. 

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{One-sided and two-sided tests}
When you are interested in checking for an increase or a decrease, but not both, use a one-sided test. When you are interested in any difference from the null value~--~an increase or decrease~--~then the test should be two-sided.\vspace{0.5mm}}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Always write the null hypothesis as an equality}
We will find it most useful if we always list the null hypothesis as an equality (e.g. $\mu = 7$) while the alternative always uses an inequality (e.g. $\mu\neq7$, $\mu>7$, or $\mu<7$).}
\end{tipBox}

The researchers at the rural school conducted a simple random sample of $n=110$ students on campus. They found that these students averaged 7.42 hours of sleep and the standard deviation of the amount of sleep for the students was 1.75 hours. A histogram of the sample is shown in Figure~\ref{histOfSleepForCollegeThatWasCheckingForMoreThan7Hours}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{ch_inference_foundations/figures/histOfSleepForCollegeThatWasCheckingForMoreThan7Hours/histOfSleepForCollegeThatWasCheckingForMoreThan7Hours}
\caption{Distribution of a night of sleep for 110 college students. These data are strongly skewed.\index{skew!example: strong}}
\label{histOfSleepForCollegeThatWasCheckingForMoreThan7Hours}
\end{figure}

Before we can use a normal model for the sample mean or compute the standard error of the sample mean, we must verify conditions. (1)~Because this is a simple random sample from less than 10\% of the student body, the observations are independent. (2)~The sample size in the sleep study is sufficiently large since it is greater than 30. (3)~The data show strong skew in Figure~\ref{histOfSleepForCollegeThatWasCheckingForMoreThan7Hours} and the presence of a couple of outliers. This skew and the outliers are acceptable for a sample size of $n=110$. With these conditions verified, the normal model can be safely applied to $\bar{x}$ and we can reasonably calculate the standard error.

\begin{exercise} \label{findSEOfFirstSleepStudyCheckingGreaterThan7Hours}
In the sleep study, the sample standard deviation was 1.75 hours and the sample size is 110. Calculate the standard error of $\bar{x}$.\footnote{The standard error can be estimated from the sample standard deviation and the sample size: $SE_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s_x}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1.75}{\sqrt{110}} = 0.17$.}
\end{exercise}

The hypothesis test for the sleep study will be evaluated using a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$. We want to consider the data under the scenario that the null hypothesis is true. In this case, the sample mean is from a distribution that is nearly normal and has mean 7 and standard deviation of about $SE_{\bar{x}} = 0.17$. Such a distribution is shown in Figure~\ref{pValueOneSidedSleepStudy}.

\begin{figure}[hht]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.83\textwidth]{ch_inference_foundations/figures/pValueOneSidedSleepStudy/pValueOneSidedSleepStudy}
   \caption{If the null hypothesis is true, then the sample mean $\bar{x}$ came from this nearly normal distribution. The right tail describes the probability of observing such a large sample mean if the null hypothesis is true.}
   \label{pValueOneSidedSleepStudy}
\end{figure}

The shaded tail in Figure~\ref{pValueOneSidedSleepStudy} represents the chance of observing such a large mean, conditional on the null hypothesis being true. That is, the shaded tail represents the \mbox{p-value}. We shade all means larger than our sample mean, $\bar{x} = 7.42$, because they are more favorable to the alternative hypothesis than the observed mean.

We compute the p-value by finding the tail area of this normal distribution, which we learned to do in Section~\ref{normalDist}. First compute the Z-score of the sample mean, $\bar{x} = 7.42$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \text{null value}}{SE_{\bar{x}}} = \frac{7.42 - 7}{0.17} = 2.47
\end{eqnarray*}
Using the normal probability table, the lower unshaded area is found to be 0.993. Thus the shaded area is $1-0.993 = 0.007$. {\em If the null hypothesis is true, the probability of observing a sample mean at least as large as 7.42 hours for a sample of 110 students is only 0.007.}\index{p-value!interpretation example} That is, if the null hypothesis is true, we would not often see such a large mean.

We evaluate the hypotheses by comparing the p-value to the significance level. Because the p-value is less than the significance level (p-value $=0.007 < 0.05=\alpha$), we reject the null hypothesis. What we observed is so unusual with respect to the null hypothesis that it casts serious doubt on $H_0$ and provides strong evidence favoring $H_A$.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{p-value as a tool in hypothesis testing}
The smaller the p-value, the stronger the data favor $H_A$ over $H_0$. A small p-value (usually $<0.05$) corresponds to sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_A$.}
\index{hypothesis testing!p-value|)}
\end{termBox}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{It is useful to first draw a picture to find the p-value}
It is useful to draw a picture of the distribution of $\bar{x}$ as though $H_0$ was true (i.e.~$\mu$~equals the null value), and shade the region (or regions) of sample means that are at least as favorable to the alternative hypothesis. These shaded regions represent the p-value.}
\end{tipBox}

The ideas below review the process of evaluating hypothesis tests with p-values:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item The null hypothesis represents a skeptic's position or a position of no difference. We reject this position only if the evidence strongly favors $H_A$.
\item A small p-value means that if the null hypothesis is true, there is a low probability of seeing a point estimate at least as extreme as the one we saw. We interpret this as strong evidence in favor of the alternative.
\item We reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is smaller than the significance level, $\alpha$, which is usually 0.05. Otherwise, we fail to reject $H_0$.
\item We should always state the conclusion of the hypothesis test in plain language so non-statisticians can also understand the results.
\end{itemize}

The p-value is constructed in such a way that we can directly compare it to the significance level ($\alpha$) to determine whether or not to reject $H_0$. This method ensures that the Type~1 Error rate does not exceed the significance level standard.

   \caption{To identify the p-value, the distribution of the sample mean is considered as if the null hypothesis was true. Then the p-value is defined and computed as the probability of the observed $\bar{x}$ or an $\bar{x}$ even more favorable to $H_A$ under this distribution.}
   \label{pValueOneSidedSleepStudyExplained}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
If the null hypothesis is true, how often should the p-value be less than 0.05?\footnote{About 5\% of the time. If the null hypothesis is true, then the data only has a 5\% chance of being in the 5\% of data most favorable to $H_A$.}
\index{data!school sleep|)}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Suppose we had used a significance level of 0.01 in the sleep study. Would the evidence have been strong enough to reject the null hypothesis? (The p-value was 0.007.) What if the significance level was $\alpha = 0.001$? \footnote{We reject the null hypothesis whenever $p$-$value < \alpha$. Thus, we would still reject the null hypothesis if $\alpha = 0.01$ but not if the significance level had been $\alpha = 0.001$.}

\begin{exercise} \label{ebayAmazonOneSidedTestExercise}
\index{data!mario\_kart|(}
Ebay might be interested in showing that buyers on its site tend to pay less than they would for the corresponding new item on Amazon. We'll research this topic for one particular product: a video game called \emph{Mario Kart} for the Nintendo Wii. During early October 2009, Amazon sold this game for \$46.99. Set up an appropriate (one-sided!) hypothesis test to check the claim that Ebay buyers pay less during auctions at this same time.\footnote{The skeptic would say the average is the same on Ebay, and we are interested in showing the average price is lower.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] The average auction price on Ebay is equal to (or more than) the price on Amazon. We write only the equality in the statistical notation: $\mu_{ebay} = 46.99$.
\item[$H_A$:] The average price on Ebay is less than the price on Amazon, $\mu_{ebay} < 46.99$.

{exerciseFor52EbayAuctionsToExamineMarioKartLessExpensiveThanAmazonConditions}
During early October 2009, 52 Ebay auctions were recorded for \emph{Mario Kart}.\footnote{These data were collected by OpenIntro staff.} The total prices for the auctions are presented using a histogram in Figure~\ref{ebayMarioKartAuctionPriceHistogramFor3ConditionsExercise}, and we may like to apply the normal model to the sample mean. Check the three conditions required for applying the normal model: (1)~independence, (2)~at~least 30 observations, and (3)~the data are not strongly skewed.\footnote{(1) The independence condition is unclear. \emph{We will make the assumption that the observations are independent, which we should report with any final results.} (2) The sample size is sufficiently large: $n =52 \geq 30$. (3) The data distribution is not strongly skewed; it is approximately symmetric.}

   \label{ebayMarioKartAuctionPriceHistogramFor3ConditionsExercise}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}{The average sale price of the 52 Ebay auctions for \emph{Wii Mario Kart} was \$44.17 with a standard deviation of \$4.15. Does this provide sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis in Guided Practice~\ref{ebayAmazonOneSidedTestExercise}? Use a significance level of $\alpha = 0.01$.}
The hypotheses were set up and the conditions were checked in Exercises~\ref{ebayAmazonOneSidedTestExercise} and~\ref{exerciseFor52EbayAuctionsToExamineMarioKartLessExpensiveThanAmazonConditions}. The next step is to find the standard error of the sample mean and produce a sketch to help find the p-value.
\begin{eqnarray*}
SE_{\bar{x}} = s/\sqrt{n} = 4.15/\sqrt{52} = 0.5755
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=35mm]{ch_inference_foundations/figures/pVForEbayAmazonComparison/pVForEbayAmazonComparison}
\end{center}
Because the alternative hypothesis says we are looking for a smaller mean, we shade the lower tail. We find this shaded area by using the Z-score and normal probability table: $Z = \frac{44.17 - 46.99}{0.5755} = -4.90$, which has area less than 0.0002. The area is so small we cannot really see it on the picture. This lower tail area corresponds to the p-value.

Because the p-value is so small -- specifically, smaller than $\alpha = 0.01$ -- this provides sufficiently strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. The data provide statistically significant evidence that the average price on Ebay is lower than Amazon's asking price.

It's common to use a threshold of 0.05 to determine whether a result is statistically significant, but why is the most common value 0.05?

\subsection{Two-sided hypothesis testing with p-values}
\label{twoSidedTestsWithPValues}

\index{data!school sleep|(}

We now consider how to compute a p-value for a two-sided test. In one-sided tests, we shade the single tail in the direction of the alternative hypothesis. For example, when the alternative had the form $\mu > 7$, then the p-value was represented by the upper tail (Figure~\ref{pValueOneSidedSleepStudyExplained}). When the alternative was $\mu < 46.99$, the p-value was the lower tail (Guided Practice~\ref{ebayAmazonOneSidedTestExercise}). In a two-sided test, \emph{we shade two tails} since evidence in either direction is favorable to $H_A$.

\begin{exercise} \label{2ndSchSleepHypSetupExercise}
Earlier we talked about a research group investigating whether the students at their school slept longer than 7 hours each night. Let's consider a second group of researchers who want to evaluate whether the students at their college differ from the norm of 7 hours. Write the null and alternative hypotheses for this investigation.\footnote{Because the researchers are interested in any difference, they should use a two-sided setup: $H_0: \mu = 7$, $H_A: \mu \neq 7$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{The second college randomly samples 122 students and finds a mean of $\bar{x} = 6.83$ hours and a standard deviation of $s=1.8$ hours. Does this provide strong evidence against $H_0$ in Guided Practice~\ref{2ndSchSleepHypSetupExercise}? Use a significance level of $\alpha=0.05$.}
First, we must verify assumptions. (1) A simple random sample of less than 10\% of the student body means the observations are independent. (2) The sample size is 122, which is greater than 30. (3) Based on the earlier distribution and what we already know about college student sleep habits, the sample size will be acceptable.

Next we can compute the standard error ($SE_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 0.16$) of the estimate and create a picture to represent the p-value, shown in Figure~\ref{2ndSchSleepHTExample}. Both tails are shaded. An estimate of 7.17 or more provides at least as strong of evidence against the null hypothesis and in favor of the alternative as the observed estimate, $\bar{x} = 6.83$.

We can calculate the tail areas by first finding the lower tail corresponding to $\bar{x}$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z = \frac{6.83 - 7.00}{0.16} = -1.06 \quad\stackrel{table}{\rightarrow}\quad \text{left tail} = 0.1446
\end{eqnarray*}
Because the normal model is symmetric, the right tail will have the same area as the left tail. The p-value is found as the sum of the two shaded tails:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{p-value} = \text{left tail} + \text{right tail} = 2\times(\text{left tail}) = 0.2892
\end{eqnarray*}
This p-value is relatively large (larger than $\alpha=0.05$), so we should not reject $H_0$. That is, if $H_0$ is true, it would not be very unusual to see a sample mean this far from 7 hours simply due to sampling variation. Thus, we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean is different than 7 hours.

\index{data!school sleep|)}

\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ch_inference_foundations/figures/2ndSchSleepHTExample/2ndSchSleepHTExample}
   \caption{$H_A$ is two-sided, so \emph{both} tails must be counted for the p-value.}
   \label{2ndSchSleepHTExample}
\end{figure}

\end{example}

\begin{example}{It is never okay to change two-sided tests to one-sided tests after observing the data. In this example we explore the consequences of ignoring this advice. Using $\alpha=0.05$, we show that freely switching from two-sided tests to one-sided tests will cause us to make twice as many Type~1 Errors as intended.} \label{swappingHypAfterDataDoublesType1ErrorRate}
Suppose the sample mean was larger than the null value, $\mu_0$ (e.g. $\mu_0$ would represent~7 if $H_0$:~$\mu = 7$). Then if we can flip to a one-sided test, we would use $H_A$: $\mu > \mu_0$. Now if we obtain any observation with a Z-score greater than 1.65, we would reject $H_0$. If the null hypothesis is true, we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis about 5\% of the time when the sample mean is above the null value, as shown in Figure~\ref{type1ErrorDoublingExampleFigure}.

Suppose the sample mean was smaller than the null value. Then if we change to a one-sided test, we would use $H_A$: $\mu < \mu_0$. If $\bar{x}$ had a Z-score smaller than -1.65, we would reject $H_0$. If the null hypothesis is true, then we would observe such a case about 5\% of the time.

By examining these two scenarios, we can determine that we will make a Type~1 Error $5\%+5\%=10\%$ of the time if we are allowed to swap to the ``best'' one-sided test for the data. This is twice the error rate we prescribed with our significance level: $\alpha=0.05$ (!).

\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{ch_inference_foundations/figures/type1ErrorDoublingExampleFigure/type1ErrorDoublingExampleFigure}
   \caption{The shaded regions represent areas where we would reject $H_0$ under the bad practices considered in Example~\ref{swappingHypAfterDataDoublesType1ErrorRate} when $\alpha = 0.05$.}
   \label{type1ErrorDoublingExampleFigure}
\end{figure}

\end{example}

\begin{caution}{One-sided hypotheses are allowed only \emph{before} seeing data}
{After observing data, it is tempting to turn a two-sided test into a one-sided test. Avoid this temptation. Hypotheses must be set up \emph{before} observing the data. If~they are not, the test should be two-sided.}
\end{caution}


\subsection{Choosing a significance level}
\label{significanceLevel}

\index{hypothesis testing!significance level|(}
\index{significance level|(}

Choosing a significance level for a test is important in many contexts, and the traditional level is 0.05. However, it is often helpful to adjust the significance level based on the application. We may select a level that is smaller or larger than 0.05 depending on the consequences of any conclusions reached from the test.

If making a Type~1 Error is dangerous or especially costly, we should choose a small significance level (e.g. 0.01). Under this scenario we want to be very cautious about rejecting the null hypothesis, so we demand very strong evidence favoring $H_A$ before we would reject $H_0$.

If a Type~2 Error is relatively more dangerous or much more costly than a Type~1 Error, then we should choose a higher significance level (e.g. 0.10). Here we want to be cautious about failing to reject $H_0$ when the null is actually false.

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle[]{Significance levels should reflect consequences of errors}
The significance level selected for a test should reflect the consequences associated with Type~1 and Type~2 Errors.}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{example}{A car manufacturer is considering a higher quality but more expensive supplier for window parts in its vehicles. They sample a number of parts from their current supplier and also parts from the new supplier. They decide that if the high quality parts will last more than 12\% longer, it makes financial sense to switch to this more expensive supplier. Is there good reason to modify the significance level in such a hypothesis test?}
The null hypothesis is that the more expensive parts last no more than 12\% longer while the alternative is that they do last more than 12\% longer. This decision is just one of the many regular factors that have a marginal impact on the car and company. A significance level of 0.05 seems reasonable since neither a Type~1 or Type~2 Error should be dangerous or (relatively) much more expensive.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{The same car manufacturer is considering a slightly more expensive supplier for parts related to safety, not windows. If the durability of these safety components is shown to be better than the current supplier, they will switch manufacturers. Is there good reason to modify the significance level in such an evaluation?}
The null hypothesis would be that the suppliers' parts are equally reliable. Because safety is involved, the car company should be eager to switch to the slightly more expensive manufacturer (reject $H_0$) even if the evidence of increased safety is only moderately strong. A slightly larger significance level, such as $\alpha=0.10$, might be appropriate.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
A part inside of a machine is very expensive to replace. However, the machine usually functions properly even if this part is broken, so the part is replaced only if we are extremely certain it is broken based on a series of measurements. Identify appropriate hypotheses for this test (in plain language) and suggest an appropriate significance level.\footnote{Here the null hypothesis is that the part is not broken, and the alternative is that it is broken. If we don't have sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$, we would not replace the part. It sounds like failing to fix the part if it is broken ($H_0$ false, $H_A$ true) is not very problematic, and replacing the part is expensive. Thus, we should require very strong evidence against $H_0$ before we replace the part. Choose a small significance level, such as $\alpha=0.01$.}

\label{cltSection}

\index{Central Limit Theorem|(}

The normal model for the sample mean tends to be very good when the sample consists of at least 30 independent observations and the population data are not strongly skewed. The Central Limit Theorem provides the theory that allows us to make this assumption.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Central Limit Theorem, informal definition}
The distribution of $\bar{x}$ is approximately normal. The approximation can be poor if the sample size is small, but it improves with larger sample sizes.}
\end{termBox}

The Central Limit Theorem states that when the sample size is small, the normal approximation may not be very good. However, as the sample size becomes large, the normal approximation improves. We will investigate three cases to see roughly when the approximation is reasonable.

We consider three data sets: one from a \emph{uniform} distribution, one from an \emph{exponential} distribution, and the other from a \emph{log-normal} distribution. These distributions are shown in the top panels of Figure~\ref{cltSimulations}. The uniform distribution is symmetric, the exponential distribution may be considered as having moderate skew since its right tail is relatively short (few outliers), and the log-normal distribution is strongly skewed and will tend to produce more apparent outliers.\index{skew!example: moderate}\index{skew!example: strong}

\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_inference_foundations/figures/cltSimulations/cltSimulations}
   \caption{Sampling distributions for the mean at different sample sizes and for three different distributions. The dashed red lines show normal distributions.}
   \label{cltSimulations}
\end{figure}

The left panel in the $n=2$ row represents the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ if it is the sample mean of two observations from the uniform distribution shown. The dashed line represents the closest approximation of the normal distribution. Similarly, the center and right panels of the $n=2$ row represent the respective distributions of $\bar{x}$ for data from exponential and log-normal distributions.

\begin{exercise}
Examine the distributions in each row of Figure~\ref{cltSimulations}. What do you notice about the normal approximation for each sampling distribution as the sample size becomes larger?\footnote{The normal approximation becomes better as larger samples are used.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{Would the normal approximation be good in all applications where the sample size is at least 30?}
Not necessarily. For example, the normal approximation for the log-normal example is questionable for a sample size of 30. Generally, the more skewed a population distribution or the more common the frequency of outliers, the larger the sample required to guarantee the distribution of the sample mean is nearly normal.
\end{example}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{With larger $n$, the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ becomes more normal}
As the sample size increases, the normal model for $\bar{x}$ becomes more reasonable. We can also relax our condition on skew when the sample size is very large.}
\end{tipBox}

We discussed in Section~\ref{seOfTheMean} that the sample standard deviation, $s$, could be used as a substitute of the population standard deviation, $\sigma$, when computing the standard error. This estimate tends to be reasonable when $n\geq30$. We will encounter alternative distributions for smaller sample sizes in Chapters~\ref{inferenceForNumericalData} and~\ref{inferenceForCategoricalData}.

\begin{example}{Figure~\ref{pokerProfitsCanApplyNormalToSampMean} shows a histogram of 50 observations. These represent winnings and losses from 50 consecutive days of a professional poker player. Can the normal approximation be applied to the sample mean, 90.69?}
We should consider each of the required conditions.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[(1)] These are referred to as \term{time series data}, because the data arrived in a particular sequence. If the player wins on one day, it may influence how she plays the next. To make the assumption of independence we should perform careful checks on such data. While the supporting analysis is not shown, no evidence was found to indicate the observations are not independent.
\item[(2)] The sample size is 50, satisfying the sample size condition.
\item[(3)] There are two outliers, one very extreme, which suggests the data are very strongly skewed or very distant outliers may be common for this type of data. Outliers can play an important role and affect the distribution of the sample mean and the estimate of the standard error.
\end{itemize}
Since we should be skeptical of the independence of observations and the very extreme upper outlier poses a challenge, we should not use the normal model for the sample mean of these 50 observations. If we can obtain a much larger sample, perhaps several hundred observations, then the concerns about skew and outliers would no longer apply.
\end{example}

\begin{figure}[ht]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[height=58mm]{ch_inference_foundations/figures/pokerProfitsCanApplyNormalToSampMean/pokerProfitsCanApplyNormalToSampMean}
   \caption{Sample distribution of poker winnings. These data include some very clear outliers. These are problematic when considering the normality of the sample mean. For example, outliers are often an indicator of very strong skew\index{skew!example: very strong}.}
   \label{pokerProfitsCanApplyNormalToSampMean}
\end{figure}

\begin{caution}
{Examine data structure when considering independence}
{Some data sets are collected in such a way that they have a natural underlying structure between observations, e.g. when observations occur consecutively. Be especially cautious about independence assumptions regarding such data sets.}
\end{caution}

\begin{caution}{Watch out for strong skew and outliers}
{Strong skew is often identified by the presence of clear outliers. If a data set has prominent outliers, or such observations are somewhat common for the type of data under study, then it is useful to collect a sample with many more than 30 observations if the normal model will be used for $\bar{x}$.}
\index{Central Limit Theorem|)}
\end{caution}

You won't be a pro at assessing skew by the end of this book, so just use your best judgement and continue learning. As you develop your statistics skills and encounter tough situations, also consider learning about better ways to analyze skewed data, such as the studentized bootstrap (bootstrap-t), or consult a more experienced statistician.

\label{aFrameworkForInference}

The sample mean is not the only point estimate for which the sampling distribution is nearly normal. For example, the sampling distribution of sample proportions closely resembles the normal distribution when the sample size is sufficiently large. In this section, we introduce a number of examples where the normal approximation is reasonable for the point estimate. Chapters~\ref{inferenceForNumericalData} and~\ref{inferenceForCategoricalData} will revisit each of the point estimates you see in this section along with some other new statistics.

We make another important assumption about each point estimate encountered in this section: the estimate is unbiased. A point estimate is \term{unbiased} if the sampling distribution of the estimate is centered at the parameter it estimates. That is, an unbiased estimate does not naturally over or underestimate the parameter. Rather, it tends to provide a ``good'' estimate. The sample mean is an example of an unbiased point estimate, as are each of the examples we introduce in this section.

Finally, we will discuss the general case where a point estimate may follow some distribution other than the normal distribution. We also provide guidance about how to handle scenarios where the statistical techniques you are familiar with are insufficient for the problem at hand.


\subsection{Confidence intervals for nearly normal point estimates}

\index{confidence interval!using normal model|(}

In Section~\ref{confidenceIntervals}, we used the point estimate $\bar{x}$ with a standard error $SE_{\bar{x}}$ to create a 95\% confidence interval for the population mean:
\begin{align}
\bar{x}\ \pm\ 1.96 \times SE_{\bar{x}}
\label{95PercCIForMeanInGeneralizingSection}
\end{align}
We constructed this interval by noting that the sample mean is within 1.96 standard errors of the actual mean about 95\% of the time. This same logic generalizes to any unbiased point estimate that is nearly normal. We may also generalize the confidence level by using a place-holder $z^{\star}$.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{General confidence interval for the normal sampling distribution case}\label{generalConfidenceIntervalTermBox}%
A confidence interval based on an unbiased and nearly normal point estimate is
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{point estimate}\ \pm\ z^{\star}SE
\label{95PercGeneralCIInGeneralizingSection}
\end{eqnarray}
where $z^{\star}$ is selected to correspond to the confidence level, and $SE$ represents the standard error. The value $z^{\star}SE$ is called the \emph{margin of error}\index{margin of error}.}
\end{termBox}

Generally the standard error for a point estimate is estimated from the data and computed using a formula. For example, the standard error for the sample mean is
\begin{eqnarray*}
SE_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{eqnarray*}
In this section, we provide the computed standard error for each example and exercise without detailing where the values came from. In future chapters, you will learn to fill in these and other details for each situation.

\begin{example}{In Guided Practice~\vref{peOfDiffActiveBetweenGender}, we computed a point estimate for the difference in the average days active per week between male and female students: $\bar{x}_{female}-\bar{x}_{male}=1.1$~days. This point estimate is associated with a nearly normal distribution with standard error $SE = 0.5$~days. What is a reasonable 95\% confidence interval for the difference in average days active per week?}
\label{ciForDiffOfPhysActiveBetweenGenders}
The normal approximation is said to be valid, so we apply Equation~\eqref{95PercGeneralCIInGeneralizingSection}:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{point estimate}\ \pm\ z^{\star} SE
	\quad\rightarrow\quad 1.1\ \pm\ 1.96\times 0.5
	\quad\rightarrow\quad (0.12, 2.08)
\end{eqnarray*}
We are 95\% confident that the male students, on average, were physically active 0.12 to 2.08 days more than female students in YRBSS each week. That is, the actual average difference is plausibly between 0.12 and 2.08 days per week with 95\% confidence.
\end{example}
%library(openintro); library(xtable); data(yrbss); data(yrbss.samp); (x <- by(yrbss.samp$physically_active_7d, yrbss.samp$gender, mean)); diff(x); s <- by(yrbss.samp$physically_active_7d, yrbss.samp$gender, sd); n <- by(yrbss.samp$physically_active_7d, yrbss.samp$gender, length); sqrt(sum(s^2/n))


\begin{example}{Does Example~\ref{ciForDiffOfPhysActiveBetweenGenders} guarantee that if a male and female student are selected at random from YRBSS, the male student would be active 0.12 to 2.08 days more than the female student?}
Our confidence interval says absolutely nothing about individual observations. It {only} makes a statement about a plausible range of values for the \emph{average} difference between all male and female students who participated in YRBSS.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise} \label{findZFor99PercConfLevelInFrameworkForInf}
What $z^{\star}$ would be appropriate for a 99\% confidence level? For help, see Figure~\vref{choosingZForCI}.\footnote{We seek $z^{\star}$ such that 99\% of the area under the normal curve will be between the Z-scores -$z^{\star}$ and $z^{\star}$. Because the remaining 1\% is found in the tails, each tail has area 0.5\%, and we can identify -$z^{\star}$ by looking up 0.0050 in the normal probability table: $z^{\star} = 2.58$. See also Figure~\vref{choosingZForCI}.}
\end{exercise}

\textC{\newpage}

\begin{exercise}
The proportion of students who are male in the \data{yrbss\_samp} sample is $\hat{p} = 0.48$. This sample meets certain conditions that ensure $\hat{p}$ will be nearly normal, and the standard error of the estimate is $SE_{\hat{p}} = 0.05$. Create a 90\% confidence interval for the proportion of students in the 2013 YRBSS survey who are male.\footnote{We use $z^{\star}=1.65$ (see Guided Practice~~\vref{find90CIForYrbssAgeExercise}), and apply the general confidence interval formula:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{p}\ \pm\ z^{\star}SE_{\hat{p}}
	\quad\to\quad 0.48\ \pm\ 1.65\times 0.05
	\quad\to\quad (0.3975, 0.5625)
\end{eqnarray*}
Thus, we are 90\% confident that between 40\% and 56\% of the YRBSS students were male.}

\end{exercise}


\subsection{Hypothesis testing for nearly normal point estimates}
\index{hypothesis testing!using normal model|(}

Just as the confidence interval method works with many other point estimates, we can generalize our hypothesis testing methods to new point estimates. Here we only consider the p-value approach, introduced in Section~\ref{pValue}, since it is the most commonly used technique and also extends to non-normal cases.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle[]{Hypothesis testing using the normal model}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item First write the hypotheses in plain language, then set them up in mathematical notation.
\item Identify an appropriate point estimate of the parameter of interest.
\item Verify conditions to ensure the standard error estimate is reasonable and the point estimate is nearly normal and unbiased.
\item Compute the standard error. Draw a picture depicting the distribution of the estimate under the idea that $H_0$ is true. Shade areas representing the p-value.
\item Using the picture and normal model, compute the \emph{test statistic} (Z-score) and identify the p-value to evaluate the hypotheses. Write a conclusion in plain language.
\end{enumerate}}
\end{termBox}

\begin{exercise} \label{fdaHypSetupForSulph}
A drug called sulphinpyrazone was under consideration for use in reducing the death rate in heart attack patients. To determine whether the drug was effective, a set of 1,475 patients were recruited into an experiment and randomly split into two groups: a control group that received a placebo and a treatment group that received the new drug. What would be an appropriate null hypothesis? And the alternative?\footnote{The skeptic's perspective is that the drug does not work at reducing deaths in heart attack patients ($H_0$), while the alternative is that the drug does work ($H_A$).}
\end{exercise}

\textC{\newpage}

We can formalize the hypotheses from Guided Practice~\ref{fdaHypSetupForSulph} by letting $p_{control}$ and $p_{treatment}$ represent the proportion of patients who died in the control and treatment groups, respectively. Then the hypotheses can be written as
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&H_0: p_{control} = p_{treatment} \quad\text{(the drug doesn't work)} \quad \\
&&H_A: p_{control} > p_{treatment} \quad\text{(the drug works)}
\end{eqnarray*}
or equivalently,
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&H_0: p_{control} - p_{treatment} = 0 \quad\text{(the drug doesn't work)} \quad \\
&&H_A: p_{control} - p_{treatment} > 0 \quad\text{(the drug works)}
\end{eqnarray*}
Strong evidence against the null hypothesis and in favor of the alternative would correspond to an observed difference in death rates,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{point estimate} = \hat{p}_{control} - \hat{p}_{treatment}
\end{eqnarray*}
being larger than we would expect from chance alone. This difference in sample proportions represents a point estimate that is useful in evaluating the hypotheses. 

\begin{example}{We want to evaluate the hypothesis setup from Guided Practice~\ref{fdaHypSetupForSulph} using data from the actual study.\footnote{Anturane Reinfarction Trial Research Group. 1980. Sulfinpyrazone in the prevention of sudden death after myocardial infarction. New England Journal of Medicine 302(5):250-256.} In the control group, 60 of 742 patients died. In the treatment group, 41 of 733 patients died. The sample difference in death rates can be summarized as
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{point estimate} = \hat{p}_{control} - \hat{p}_{treatment} = \frac{60}{742} - \frac{41}{733} = 0.025
\end{eqnarray*}
This point estimate is nearly normal and is an unbiased estimate of the actual difference in death rates. The standard error of this sample difference is $SE = 0.013$. Evaluate the hypothesis test at a 5\% significance level: $\alpha=0.05$.}
We would like to identify the p-value to evaluate the hypotheses. If the null hypothesis is true, then the point estimate would have come from a nearly normal distribution, like the one shown in Figure~\ref{sulphStudyFindPValueUsingNormalApprox}. The distribution is centered at zero since $p_{control}-p_{treatment}=0$ under the null hypothesis. Because a large positive difference provides evidence against the null hypothesis and in favor of the alternative, the upper tail has been shaded to represent the p-value. We need not shade the lower tail since this is a one-sided test: an observation in the lower tail does not support the alternative hypothesis.

\begin{figure}[bt]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.88\textwidth]{ch_inference_foundations/figures/sulphStudyFindPValueUsingNormalApprox/sulphStudyFindPValueUsingNormalApprox}
   \caption{The distribution of the sample difference if the null hypothesis is true.}
   \label{sulphStudyFindPValueUsingNormalApprox}
\end{figure}

The p-value can be computed by using the Z-score of the point estimate and the normal probability table.
\begin{eqnarray}
Z = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE_{\text{point estimate}}}
	= \frac{0.025 - 0}{0.013} = 1.92
\label{zScoreOfPointEstimateForSulphinpyrazoneThisIsFirstTestStatReference}
\end{eqnarray}
Examining Z in the normal probability table, we find that the lower unshaded tail is about 0.973. Thus, the upper shaded tail representing the p-value is
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{p-value} = 1-0.973 = 0.027
\end{eqnarray*}
Because the p-value is less than the significance level ($\alpha=0.05$), we say the null hypothesis is implausible. That is, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative and conclude that the drug is effective at reducing deaths in heart attack patients.
\end{example}

The Z-score in Equation~(\ref{zScoreOfPointEstimateForSulphinpyrazoneThisIsFirstTestStatReference}) is called a \term{test statistic}. In most hypothesis tests, a test statistic is a particular data summary that is especially useful for computing the p-value and evaluating the hypothesis test. In the case of point estimates that are nearly normal, the test statistic is the Z-score.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Test statistic}
A \emph{test statistic} is a summary statistic that is particularly useful for evaluating a hypothesis test or identifying the p-value. When a point estimate is nearly normal, we use the Z-score of the point estimate as the test statistic. In later chapters we encounter situations where other test statistics are helpful.}
\index{hypothesis testing!using normal model|)}
\end{termBox}


\subsection{Non-normal point estimates}

We may apply the ideas of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing to cases where the point estimate or test statistic is not necessarily normal. There are many reasons why such a situation may arise:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item the sample size is too small for the normal approximation to be valid;
\item the standard error estimate may be poor; or
\item the point estimate tends towards some distribution that is not the normal distribution.
\end{itemize}
For each case where the normal approximation is not valid, our first task is always to understand and characterize the sampling distribution of the point estimate or test statistic. Next, we can apply the general frameworks for confidence intervals and hypothesis testing to these alternative distributions.

\subsection{When to retreat}
\label{whenToRetreat}

Statistical tools rely on conditions. When the conditions are not met, these tools are unreliable and drawing conclusions from them is treacherous. The conditions for these tools typically come in two forms.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item \textbf{The individual observations must be independent.} A random sample from less than 10\% of the population ensures the observations are independent. In experiments, we generally require that subjects are randomized into groups. If independence fails, then advanced techniques must be used, and in some such cases, inference may not be possible.
\item \textbf{Other conditions focus on sample size and skew.} For example, if the sample size is too small, the skew too strong, or extreme outliers are present, then the normal model for the sample mean will fail.
\end{itemize}
Verification of conditions for statistical tools is always necessary. Whenever conditions are not satisfied for a statistical technique, there are three options. The first is to learn new methods that are appropriate for the data. The second route is to consult a statistician.\footnote{If you work at a university, then there may be campus consulting services to assist you. Alternatively, there are many private consulting firms that are also available for hire.} The third route is to ignore the failure of conditions. This last option effectively invalidates any analysis and may discredit novel and interesting findings.

Finally, we caution that there may be no inference tools helpful when considering data that include unknown biases, such as convenience samples. For this reason, there are books, courses, and researchers devoted to the techniques of sampling and experimental design. See Sections~\ref{overviewOfDataCollectionPrinciples}-\ref{experimentsSection} for basic principles of data collection.


\subsection{Statistical significance versus practical significance}

When the sample size becomes larger, point estimates become more precise and any real differences in the mean and null value become easier to detect and recognize. Even a very small difference would likely be detected if we took a large enough sample. Sometimes researchers will take such large samples that even the slightest difference is detected. While we still say that difference is \term{statistically significant}, it might not be \term{practically significant}.

Statistically significant differences are sometimes so minor that they are not practically relevant. This is especially important to research: if we conduct a study, we want to focus on finding a meaningful result. We don't want to spend lots of money finding results that hold no practical value.

The role of a statistician in conducting a study often includes planning the size of the study. The statistician might first consult experts or scientific literature to learn what would be the smallest meaningful difference from the null value. She also would obtain some reasonable estimate for the standard deviation. With these important pieces of information, she would choose a sufficiently large sample size so that the power for the meaningful difference is perhaps 80\% or 90\%. While larger sample sizes may still be used, she might advise against using them in some cases, especially in sensitive areas of research.

In 2013, the Pew Research Foundation reported that ``45\% of U.S. adults report 
that they live with one or more chronic conditions''.
\footfullcite{data:pewdiagnosis:2013} However, this value was based on a sample, 
so it may not be a perfect estimate for the population parameter of interest on 
its own. The study reported a standard error of about 1.2\%, and a normal model 
may reasonably be used in this setting. Create a 95\% confidence interval for 
the proportion of U.S. adults who live with one or more chronic conditions. Also 
interpret the confidence interval in the context of the study.

A poll conducted in 2013 found that 52\% of U.S. adult Twitter users 
get at least some news on Twitter.\footfullcite{data:pewtwitternews:2013}. 
The standard error for this estimate was 2.4\%, and a normal distribution 
may be used to model the sample proportion. Construct a 99\% confidence 
interval for the fraction of U.S. adult Twitter users who get some 
news on Twitter, and interpret the confidence interval in context.

\eoce{\qt{Chronic illness, Part II\label{chronic_illness_tf}} In 2013, the Pew Research Foundation reported that 
``45\% of U.S. adults report that they live with one or more chronic 
conditions'', and the standard error for this estimate is 1.2\%. Identify each 
of the following statements as true or false. Provide an explanation to justify 
each of your answers.
\begin{parts}
\item We can say with certainty that the confidence interval from 
Exerise~\ref{chronic_illness_intro} contains the true percentage of U.S. adults who 
suffer from a chronic illness.
\item If we repeated this study 1,000 times and constructed a 95\% confidence 
interval for each study, then approximately 950 of those confidence intervals 
would contain the true fraction of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses.
\item The poll provides statistically significant evidence (at the 
$\alpha = 0.05$ level) that the percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from 
chronic illnesses is below 50\%.
\item Since the standard error is 1.2\%, only 1.2\% of people in the study 
communicated uncertainty about their answer.

\eoce{\qt{Twitter users and news, Part II\label{twitter_users_tf}} A poll conducted in 2013 found that 52\% of 
U.S. adult Twitter users get at least some news on Twitter, and the standard 
error for this estimate was 2.4\%. Identify each of the following statements as 
true or false. Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.
\begin{parts}
\item The data provide statistically significant evidence that more than half of 
U.S. adult Twitter users get some news through Twitter. Use a significance level 
of $\alpha = 0.01$.
\item Since the standard error is 2.4\%, we can conclude that 97.6\% of all U.S. 
adult Twitter users were included in the study.
\item If we want to reduce the standard error of the estimate, we should collect 
less data.
\item If we construct a 90\% confidence interval for the percentage of U.S. 
adults Twitter users who get some news through Twitter, this confidence interval 
will be wider than a corresponding 99\% confidence interval.

``After an average work day, about how many hours do you have to relax or pursue 
activities that you enjoy?" to a random sample of 1,155 Americans.\footfullcite{data:gss:2010} A 95\% confidence interval for the mean number of hours spent 
relaxing or pursuing activities they enjoy was (1.38, 1.92).
\begin{parts}
\item Interpret this interval in context of the data.
\item Suppose another set of researchers reported a confidence interval with a 
larger margin of error based on the same sample of 1,155 Americans. How does 
their confidence level compare to the confidence level of the interval stated 
above?
\item Suppose next year a new survey asking the same question is conducted, and 
this time the sample size is 2,500. Assuming that the population 
characteristics, with respect to how much time people spend relaxing after work,

mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, 
not good?" Based on responses from 1,151 US residents, the survey reported a 95\%
 confidence interval of 3.40 to 4.24 days in 2010.
\begin{parts}
\item Interpret this interval in context of the data.
\item What does ``95\% confident" mean? Explain in the context of the application.
\item Suppose the researchers think a 99\% confidence level would be more 
appropriate for this interval. Will this new interval be smaller or larger than 
the 95\% confidence interval?
\item If a new survey were to be done with 500 Americans, would the standard

hoping to improve wait times decides to estimate the average emergency 
room waiting time at her hospital. She collects a simple random sample 
of 64 patients and determines the time (in minutes) between when they 
checked in to the ER until they were first seen by a doctor. A 95\% 
confidence interval based on this sample is (128 minutes, 147 minutes), 
which is based on the normal model for the mean. Determine whether the 
following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning.
\begin{parts}
\item This confidence interval is not valid since we do not know if the 
population distribution of the ER wait times is nearly Normal.
\item We are 95\% confident that the average waiting time of these 64 emergency 
room patients is between 128 and 147 minutes.
\item We are 95\% confident that the average waiting time of all patients at 
this hospital's emergency room is between 128 and 147 minutes.
\item 95\% of random samples have a sample mean between 128 and 147 minutes.
\item A 99\% confidence interval would be narrower than the 95\% confidence 
interval since we need to be more sure of our estimate.
\item The margin of error is 9.5 and the sample mean is 137.5.
\item In order to decrease the margin of error of a 95\% confidence interval to

sampled American adults were surveyed. Daily consumer spending for the 
six-day period after Thanksgiving, spanning the Black Friday weekend and 
Cyber Monday, averaged \$84.71. A 95\% confidence interval based on

\chapter{Inference for numerical data}
\label{inferenceForNumericalData}

Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference} introduced a framework for statistical inference based on confidence intervals and hypotheses. In this chapter, we encounter several new point estimates and scenarios. In each case, the inference ideas remain the same:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Determine which point estimate or test statistic is useful.
\item Identify an appropriate distribution for the point estimate or test statistic.
\item Apply the ideas from Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference} using the distribution from step 2.
\end{enumerate}



%__________________
\section{One-sample means with the $t$-distribution}
\label{oneSampleMeansWithTDistribution}

We required a large sample in Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference} for two reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item The sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ tends to be more normal when the sample is large.
\item The calculated standard error is typically very accurate when using a large sample.
\end{enumerate}
So what should we do when the sample size is small? As we'll discuss in Section~\ref{normalityCond}, if the population data are nearly normal, then $\bar{x}$ will also follow a normal distribution, which addresses the first problem. The accuracy of the standard error is trickier, and for this challenge we'll introduce a new distribution called the $t$-distribution.

While we emphasize the use of the $t$-distribution for small samples, this distribution is also generally used for large samples, where it produces similar results to those from the normal distribution.


\subsection{The normality condition}
\label{normalityCond}

A special case of the Central Limit Theorem ensures the distribution of sample means will be nearly normal, regardless of sample size, when the data come from a nearly normal distribution.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Central Limit Theorem for normal data}
The sampling distribution of the mean is nearly normal when the sample observations are independent and come from a nearly normal distribution. This is true for any sample size.
\index{Central Limit Theorem!normal data|)}}
\end{termBox}

While this seems like a very helpful special case, there is one small problem. It is inherently difficult to verify normality in small data sets.

\begin{caution}
{Checking the normality condition}
{We should exercise caution when verifying the normality condition for small samples. It is important to not only examine the data but also think about where the data come from. For example, ask: would I expect this distribution to be symmetric, and am I confident that outliers are rare?}
\end{caution}

You may relax the normality condition as the sample size goes up. If the sample size is~10 or more, slight skew is not problematic. Once the sample size hits about~30, then moderate skew is reasonable. Data with strong skew or outliers require a more cautious analysis.


\subsection{Introducing the $t$-distribution}
\label{introducingTheTDistribution}

\index{t-distribution|(}
\index{distribution!$t$|(}

In the cases where we will use a small sample to calculate the standard error, it will be useful to rely on a new distribution for inference calculations: the $t$-distribution. A $t$-distribution, shown as a solid line in Figure~\ref{tDistCompareToNormalDist}, has a bell shape. However, its tails are thicker than the normal model's. This means observations are more likely to fall beyond two standard deviations from the mean than under the normal distribution.\footnote{The standard deviation of the $t$-distribution is actually a little more than 1. However, it is useful to always think of the $t$-distribution as having a standard deviation of 1 in all of our applications.} While our estimate of the standard error will be a little less accurate when we are analyzing a small data set, these extra thick tails of the $t$-distribution are exactly the correction we need to resolve the problem of a poorly estimated standard error.

\end{figure}

The $t$-distribution, always centered at zero, has a single parameter: degrees of freedom. The \termsub{degrees of freedom (df)}{degrees of freedom (df)!$t$-distribution} describe the precise form of the bell-shaped $t$-distribution. Several $t$-distributions are shown in Figure~\ref{tDistConvergeToNormalDist}. When there are more degrees of freedom, the $t$-distribution looks very much like the standard normal distribution.

\begin{figure}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Degrees of freedom (df)}
The degrees of freedom describe the shape of the $t$-distribution. The larger the degrees of freedom, the more closely the distribution approximates the normal model.}
\end{termBox}

When the degrees of freedom is about 30 or more, the $t$-distribution is nearly indistinguishable from the normal distribution. In Section~\ref{tDistSolutionToSEProblem}, we relate degrees of freedom to sample size.

It's very useful to become familiar with the $t$-distribution, because it allows us greater flexibility than the normal distribution when analyzing numerical data. We use a \term{t-table}, partially shown in Table~\ref{tTableSample}, in place of the normal probability table. A larger $t$-table is in Appendix~\ref{tDistributionTable} on page~\pageref{tDistributionTable}. In~practice, it's more common to use statistical software instead of a table, and you can see some of these options at

\label{tTableSample}
\end{table}

Each row in the $t$-table represents a $t$-distribution with different degrees of freedom. The columns correspond to tail probabilities. For instance, if we know we are working with the $t$-distribution with $df=18$, we can examine row 18, which is highlighted in Table~\ref{tTableSample}. If we want the value in this row that identifies the cutoff for an upper tail of 10\%, we can look in the column where \emph{one tail} is 0.100. This cutoff is 1.33. If we had wanted the cutoff for the lower 10\%, we would use -1.33. Just like the normal distribution, all $t$-distributions are symmetric.

\begin{example}{What proportion of the $t$-distribution with 18 degrees of freedom falls below -2.10?}
Just like a normal probability problem, we first draw the picture in Figure~\ref{tDistDF18LeftTail2Point10} and shade the area below -2.10. To find this area, we identify the appropriate row: \mbox{$df=18$}. Then we identify the column containing the absolute value of -2.10; it~is the third column. Because we are looking for just one tail, we examine the top line of the table, which shows that a one tail area for a value in the third row corresponds to 0.025. About 2.5\% of the distribution falls below -2.10. In the next example we encounter a case where the exact $t$ value is not listed in the table.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{A $t$-distribution with 20 degrees of freedom is shown in the left panel of Figure~\ref{tDistDF20RightTail1Point65}. Estimate the proportion of the distribution falling above 1.65.}
We identify the row in the $t$-table using the degrees of freedom: $df=20$. Then we look for 1.65; it is not listed. It falls between the first and second columns. Since these values bound 1.65, their tail areas will bound the tail area corresponding to 1.65. We identify the one tail area of the first and second columns, 0.050 and 0.10, and we conclude that between 5\% and 10\% of the distribution is more than 1.65 standard deviations above the mean. If we like, we can identify the precise area using statistical software: 0.0573.

\begin{example}{A $t$-distribution with 2 degrees of freedom is shown in the right panel of Figure~\ref{tDistDF20RightTail1Point65}. Estimate the proportion of the distribution falling more than 3 units from the mean (above or below).}
As before, first identify the appropriate row: $df=2$. Next, find the columns that capture 3; because $2.92 < 3 < 4.30$, we use the second and third columns. Finally, we find bounds for the tail areas by looking at the two tail values: 0.05 and 0.10. We use the two tail values because we are looking for two (symmetric) tails.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
What proportion of the $t$-distribution with 19 degrees of freedom falls above -1.79 units?\footnote{We find the shaded area \emph{above} -1.79 (we leave the picture to you). The small left tail is between 0.025 and 0.05, so the larger upper region must have an area between 0.95 and 0.975.}

\subsection{Conditions for using the $t$-distribution for inference on a sample mean}
\label{tDistSolutionToSEProblem}

To proceed with the $t$-distribution for inference about a single mean, we first check two conditions.
\begin{description}
\item[Independence of observations.] We verify this condition just as we did before. We collect a simple random sample from less than 10\% of the population, or if the data are from an experiment or random process, we check to the best of our abilities that the observations were independent.
\item[Observations come from a nearly normal distribution.] This second condition is difficult to verify with small data sets. We often (i) take a look at a plot of the data for obvious departures from the normal model, and (ii) consider whether any previous experiences alert us that the data may not be nearly normal.
\end{description}
When examining a sample mean and estimated standard error from a sample of $n$ independent and nearly normal observations, we use a $t$-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom~($df$). For example, if the sample size was 19, then we would use the $t$-distribution with $df=19-1=18$ degrees of freedom and proceed exactly as we did in Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference}, except that \emph{now we use the $t$-distribution}.

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{When to use the $t$-distribution}
Use the $t$-distribution for inference of the sample mean when observations are independent and nearly normal. You may relax the nearly normal condition as the sample size increases. For example, the data distribution may be moderately skewed when the sample size is at least~30.}
\end{tipBox}


\subsection{One sample $t$-confidence intervals}
\label{oneSampleTConfidenceIntervals}

\index{data!dolphins and mercury|(}

Dolphins are at the top of the oceanic food chain, which causes dangerous substances such as mercury to concentrate in their organs and muscles. This is an important problem for both dolphins and other animals, like humans, who occasionally eat them. For instance, this is particularly relevant in Japan where school meals have included dolphin at times.

\setlength{\captionwidth}{\mycaptionwidth}

Here we identify a confidence interval for the average mercury content in dolphin muscle using a sample of 19 Risso's dolphins from the Taiji area in Japan.\footnote{Taiji was featured in the movie \emph{The Cove}, and it is a significant source of dolphin and whale meat in Japan. Thousands of dolphins pass through the Taiji area annually, and we will assume these 19 dolphins represent a simple random sample from those dolphins. Data reference: Endo T and Haraguchi K. 2009. High mercury levels in hair samples from residents of Taiji, a Japanese whaling town. Marine Pollution Bulletin 60(5):743-747.} The data are summarized in Table~\ref{summaryStatsOfHgInMuscleOfRissosDolphins}. The minimum and maximum observed values can be used to evaluate whether or not there are obvious outliers or skew.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc cc}
\hline
$n$ & $\bar{x}$ & $s$ & minimum & maximum \\
19   & 4.4	  & 2.3  & 1.7	       & 9.2 \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary of mercury content in the muscle of 19 Risso's dolphins from the Taiji area. Measurements are in $\mu$g/wet g (micrograms of mercury per wet gram of muscle).}
\label{summaryStatsOfHgInMuscleOfRissosDolphins}
\end{table}

\begin{example}{Are the independence and normality conditions satisfied for this data~set?}
The observations are a simple random sample and consist of less than 10\% of the population, therefore independence is reasonable. The summary statistics in Table~\ref{summaryStatsOfHgInMuscleOfRissosDolphins} do not suggest any skew or outliers; all observations are within 2.5 standard deviations of the mean. Based on this evidence, the normality assumption seems reasonable.
\end{example}

In the normal model, we used $z^{\star}$ and the standard error to determine the width of a confidence interval. We revise the confidence interval formula slightly when using the $t$-distribution:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\bar{x} \ \pm\  t^{\star}_{df}SE
\end{eqnarray*}
\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-9mm}

$t^{\star}_{df}$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Multiplication\\factor for\\$t$ conf. interval]{\raggedright\vspace{-9mm}

$t^{\star}_{df}$\vspace{1mm}\\\footnotesize Multiplication\\factor for\\$t$ conf. interval}The sample mean and estimated standard error are computed just as before ($\bar{x} = 4.4$ and $SE = s/\sqrt{n} = 0.528$). The value $t^{\star}_{df}$ is a cutoff we obtain based on the confidence level and the $t$-distribution with $df$ degrees of freedom. Before determining this cutoff, we will first need the degrees of freedom.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Degrees of freedom for a single sample}
If the sample has $n$ observations and we are examining a single mean, then we use the $t$-distribution with $df=n-1$ degrees of freedom.}
\end{termBox}

In our current example, we should use the $t$-distribution with $df=19-1=18$ degrees of freedom. Then identifying $t_{18}^{\star}$ is similar to how we found $z^{\star}$. 
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item For a 95\% confidence interval, we want to find the cutoff $t^{\star}_{18}$ such that 95\% of the $t$-distribution is between -$t^{\star}_{18}$ and $t^{\star}_{18}$.
\item We look in the $t$-table on page~\pageref{tTableSample}, find the column with area totaling 0.05 in the two tails (third column), and then the row with 18 degrees of freedom: $t^{\star}_{18} = 2.10$.
\end{itemize}
Generally the value of $t^{\star}_{df}$ is slightly larger than what we would get under the normal model with~$z^{\star}$.



Finally, we can substitute all our values into the confidence interval equation to create the 95\% confidence interval for the average mercury content in muscles from Risso's dolphins that pass through the Taiji area:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\bar{x} \ \pm\  t^{\star}_{18}SE
	\quad \to \quad
4.4 \ \pm\  2.10 \times 0.528
	\quad \to \quad
(3.29, 5.51)
\end{eqnarray*}
We are 95\% confident the average mercury content of muscles in Risso's dolphins is between 3.29 and 5.51 $\mu$g/wet gram, which is considered extremely high.

The FDA's webpage provides some data on mercury content of fish.\footnote{\oiRedirect{textbook-fda_mercury_in_fish_2010}{www.fda.gov/food/foodborneillnesscontaminants/metals/ucm115644.htm}} Based on a sample of 15 croaker white fish (Pacific), a sample mean and standard deviation were computed as 0.287 and 0.069 ppm (parts per million), respectively. The 15 observations ranged from 0.18 to 0.41 ppm. We will assume these observations are independent. Based on the summary statistics of the data, do you have any objections to the normality condition of the individual observations?\footnote{There are no obvious outliers; all observations are within 2 standard deviations of the mean. If there is skew, it is not evident. There are no red flags for the normal model based on this (limited) information, and we do not have reason to believe the mercury content is not nearly normal in this type of fish.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{Estimate the standard error of $\bar{x}=0.287$ ppm using the data summaries in Guided Practice~\ref{croakerWhiteFishPacificExerConditions}. If we are to use the $t$-distribution to create a 90\% confidence interval for the actual mean of the mercury content, identify the degrees of freedom we should use and also find $t^{\star}_{df}$.}
\label{croakerWhiteFishPacificExerSEDFTStar}
The standard error: $SE = \frac{0.069}{\sqrt{15}} = 0.0178$. Degrees of freedom: $df = n - 1 = 14$.

\subsection{One sample $t$-tests}
\label{oneSampleTTests}

Is the typical US runner getting faster or slower over time? We consider this question in the context of the Cherry Blossom Race, which is a 10-mile race in Washington, DC each~spring.\footnote{\oiRedirect{textbook-cherryblossom_org}{www.cherryblossom.org}}

The average time for all runners who finished the Cherry Blossom Race in 2006 was 93.29 minutes (93 minutes and about 17 seconds). We want to determine using data from 100 participants in the 2012 Cherry Blossom Race whether runners in this race are getting faster or slower, versus the other possibility that there has been no change.

\begin{exercise}
What are appropriate hypotheses for this context?\footnote{$H_0$: The average 10 mile run time was the same for 2006 and 2012. $\mu = 93.29$ minutes. $H_A$: The average 10 mile run time for 2012 was \emph{different} than that of 2006. $\mu \neq 93.29$ minutes.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
The data come from a simple random sample from less than 10\% of all participants, so the observations are independent. However, should we be worried about skew in the data? See Figure~\ref{run10SampTimeHistogram} for a histogram of the differences.\footnote{With a sample of 100, we should only be concerned if there is very strong skew. The histogram of the data suggests, at worst, slight skew.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_means/figures/run10SampTimeHistogram/run10SampTimeHistogram} 
\caption{A histogram of \var{time} for the sample Cherry Blossom Race data.}
\label{run10SampTimeHistogram}
\end{figure}

With independence satisfied and slight skew not a concern for this large of a sample, we can proceed with performing a hypothesis test using the $t$-distribution.

\begin{exercise}
The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the sample of 100 runners from the 2012 Cherry Blossom Race are 95.61 and 15.78 minutes, respectively. Recall that the sample size is 100. What is the p-value for the test, and what is your conclusion?\footnote{With the conditions satisfied for the $t$-distribution, we can compute the standard error ($SE = 15.78 / \sqrt{100} = 1.58$ and the \emph{T-score}: $T = \frac{95.61 - 93.29}{1.58} = 1.47$. (There is more on this after the guided practice, but a T-score and Z-score are calculated in the same way.) For $df = 100 - 1 = 99$, we would find $T = 1.47$ to fall between the first and second column, which means the p-value is between 0.10 and 0.20 (use $df = 90$ and consider two tails since the test is two-sided). The p-value could also have been calculated more precisely with statistical software: 0.1447. Because the p-value is greater than 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis. That is, the data do not provide strong evidence that the average run time for the Cherry Blossom Run in 2012 is any different than the 2006 average.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{When using a $t$-distribution, we use a T-score (same as Z-score)}
To help us remember to use the $t$-distribution, we use a $T$ to represent the test statistic, and we often call this a \term{T-score}. The Z-score and T-score are computed in the exact same way and are conceptually identical: each represents how many standard errors the observed value is from the null value.}

Are textbooks actually cheaper online? Here we compare the price of textbooks at the University of California, Los Angeles' (UCLA's) bookstore and prices at Amazon.com. Seventy-three UCLA courses were randomly sampled in Spring 2010, representing less than 10\% of all UCLA courses.\footnote{When a class had multiple books, only the most expensive text was considered.} A portion of the data set is shown in Table~\ref{textbooksDF}.

\subsection{Paired observations}

Each textbook has two corresponding prices in the data set: one for the UCLA bookstore and one for Amazon. Therefore, each textbook price from the UCLA bookstore has a natural correspondence with a textbook price from Amazon. When two sets of observations have this special correspondence, they are said to be \term{paired}.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Paired data}
Two sets of observations are \emph{paired} if each observation in one set has a special correspondence or connection with exactly one observation in the other data set.}
\end{termBox}

To analyze paired data, it is often useful to look at the difference in outcomes of each pair of observations. In the \data{textbook} data set, we look at the differences in prices, which is represented as the \var{diff} variable in the \data{textbooks} data. Here the differences are taken as
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{UCLA price} - \text{Amazon price}
\end{eqnarray*}
for each book. It is important that we always subtract using a consistent order; here Amazon prices are always subtracted from UCLA prices. A histogram of these differences is shown in Figure~\ref{diffInTextbookPricesS10}. Using differences between paired observations is a common and useful way to analyze paired data.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.93\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_means/figures/textbooksS10/diffInTextbookPricesS10}
\caption{Histogram of the difference in price for each book sampled. These data are strongly skewed.\index{skew!example: strong}}
\label{diffInTextbookPricesS10}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
The first difference shown in Table~\ref{textbooksDF} is computed as $27.67-27.95=-0.28$. Verify the differences are calculated correctly for observations~2 and~3.\footnote{Observation 2: $40.59 - 31.14 = 9.45$. Observation 3: $31.68 - 32.00 = -0.32$.}
\end{exercise}


\subsection{Inference for paired data}

To analyze a paired data set, we simply analyze the differences. We can use the same $t$-distribution techniques we applied in the last section.

\begin{table}[hh]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
\hline
$n_{_{diff}}$	&\hspace{3mm}& $\bar{x}_{_{diff}}$	&\hspace{3mm}& $s_{_{diff}}$ \vspace{1mm}\\
73			&& 12.76				&& 14.26 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary statistics for the price differences. There were 73 books, so there are 73 differences.}
\label{textbooksSummaryStats}
\end{table}

\begin{example}{Set up and implement a hypothesis test to determine whether, on average, there is a difference between Amazon's price for a book and the UCLA bookstore's price.}
\label{htForDiffInUCLAAndAmazonTextbookPrices}
We are considering two scenarios: there is no difference or there is some difference in average prices.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] $\mu_{diff}=0$. There is no difference in the average textbook price.
\item[$H_A$:] $\mu_{diff} \neq 0$. There is a difference in average prices.
\end{itemize}

Can the $t$-distribution be used for this application? The observations are based on a simple random sample from less than 10\% of all books sold at the bookstore, so independence is reasonable. While the distribution is strongly skewed, the sample is reasonably large ($n=73$), so we can proceed. Because the conditions are reasonably satisfied, we can apply the $t$-distribution to this setting.

We compute the standard error associated with $\bar{x}_{diff}$ using the standard deviation of the differences ($s_{_{diff}}=14.26$) and the number of differences ($n_{_{diff}}=73$):
$$SE_{\bar{x}_{diff}} = \frac{s_{diff}}{\sqrt{n_{diff}}} = \frac{14.26}{\sqrt{73}} = 1.67$$
To visualize the p-value, the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}_{diff}$ is drawn as though $H_0$ is true, which is shown in Figure~\ref{textbooksS10HTTails}. The p-value is represented by the two (very) small tails.

To find the tail areas, we compute the test statistic, which is the T-score of $\bar{x}_{diff}$ under the null condition that the actual mean difference is 0:
\begin{align*}
T = \frac{\bar{x}_{diff} - 0}{SE_{x_{diff}}} = \frac{12.76 - 0}{1.67} = 7.65
\end{align*}
The degrees of freedom are $df = 73 - 1 = 72$. If we examined Appendix~\vref{tDistributionTable}, we would see that this value is larger than any in the 70 df row (we round down for $df$ when using the table), meaning the two-sided p-value is less than 0.01. If we used statistical software, we would find the p-value is less than 1-in-10 billion! Because the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. We have found convincing evidence that Amazon was, on average, cheaper than the UCLA bookstore for UCLA course textbooks.

\section{Difference of two means}
\label{differenceOfTwoMeans}

{
In this section we consider a difference in two population means, $\mu_1 - \mu_2$, under the condition that the data are not paired. Just as with a single sample, we identify conditions to ensure we can use the $t$-distribution with a point estimate of the difference, $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$.

We apply these methods in three contexts: determining whether stem cells can improve heart function, exploring the impact of pregnant womens' smoking habits on birth weights of newborns, and exploring whether there is statistically significant evidence that one variations of an exam is harder than another variation. This section is motivated by questions like ``Is there convincing evidence that newborns from mothers who smoke have a different average birth weight than newborns from mothers who don't smoke?''

\subsection{Confidence interval for a difference of means}

\index{data!stem cells, heart function|(}
\index{point estimate!difference of means|(}

Does treatment using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve heart function following a heart attack? Table~\ref{summaryStatsForSheepHeartDataWhoReceivedMiceESCs} contains summary statistics for an experiment to test ESCs in sheep that had a heart attack. Each of these sheep was randomly assigned to the ESC or control group, and the change in their hearts' pumping capacity was measured in the study. A~positive value corresponds to increased pumping capacity, which generally suggests a stronger recovery. Our goal will be to identify a 95\% confidence interval for the effect of ESCs on the change in heart pumping capacity relative to the control group.

A point estimate of the difference in the heart pumping variable can be found using the difference in the sample means:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\bar{x}_{esc} - \bar{x}_{control}\ =\ 3.50 - (-4.33)\ =\ 7.83
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l rrrrr}
\hline
\hspace{10mm}	& $n$	& $\bar{x}$	& $s$  	 \\
\hline
ESCs		& 9		& 3.50		& 5.17  	\\
control		& 9		& -4.33		& 2.76  	 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary statistics of the embryonic stem cell study.}
\label{summaryStatsForSheepHeartDataWhoReceivedMiceESCs}
\end{table}

%\begin{example}{Set up hypotheses that will be used to test whether there is convincing evidence that ESCs actually increase the amount of blood the heart pumps. Also, check conditions for using the $t$-distribution for inference with the point estimate $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$. To assist in this assessment, the data are presented in Figure~\ref{stemCellTherapyForHearts}.}\label{exampleToEvaluteWhetherESCsAreHelpfulInImprovingHeartFunctionInSheep}
%We first setup the hypotheses:
%\begin{itemize}
%\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
%\item[$H_0$:] The stem cells do not improve heart pumping function. $\mu_{esc} - \mu_{control} = 0$.
%\item[$H_A$:] The stem cells do improve heart pumping function. $\mu_{esc} - \mu_{control} > 0$.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{example}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Using the $t$-distribution for a difference in means}
\label{ConditionsForTwoSampleTDist}The $t$-distribution can be used for inference when working with the standardized difference of two means if (1) each sample meets the conditions for using the $t$-distribution and (2) the samples are independent.}
\end{termBox}

\begin{example}{Can the $t$-distribution be used to make inference using the point estimate, $\bar{x}_{esc} - \bar{x}_{control} = 7.83$?}
We check the two required conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In this study, the sheep were independent of each other. Additionally, the distributions in Figure~\ref{stemCellTherapyForHearts} don't show any clear deviations from normality, where we watch for prominent outliers in particular for such small samples. These findings imply each sample mean could itself be modeled using a $t$-distribution.
\item The sheep in each group were also independent of each other.
\end{enumerate}
Because both conditions are met, we can use the $t$-distribution to model the difference of the two sample means.
\end{example}

\end{figure}

%\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Conditions for applying the $t$-distribution to $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$}
%If the sample means, $\bar{x}_1$ and $\bar{x}_2$, each meet the criteria for using the $t$-distribution and the observations in the two samples are independent, then we can analyze the difference in sample means using the $t$-distribution.}
%\end{termBox}

\index{point estimate!difference of means|)}
\index{standard error (SE)!difference in means}

We can quantify the variability in the point estimate, $\bar{x}_{esc} - \bar{x}_{control}$, using the following formula for its standard error:
\index{standard error (SE)!difference in means}
\begin{eqnarray*}
SE_{\bar{x}_{esc} - \bar{x}_{control}} = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{esc}^2}{n_{esc}} + \frac{\sigma_{control}^2}{n_{control}}}
\end{eqnarray*}
We usually estimate this standard error using standard deviation estimates  based on the samples:
\begin{align*}
SE_{\bar{x}_{esc} - \bar{x}_{control}}
	&= \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{esc}^2}{n_{esc}} + \frac{\sigma_{control}^2}{n_{control}}} \\
	&\approx \sqrt{\frac{s_{esc}^2}{n_{esc}} + \frac{s_{control}^2}{n_{control}}}
	= \sqrt{\frac{5.17^2}{9} + \frac{2.76^2}{9}} = 1.95
\end{align*}
Because we will use the $t$-distribution, we also must identify the appropriate degrees of freedom. This can be done using computer software. An alternative technique is to use the smaller of $n_1 - 1$ and $n_2 - 1$, which is the method we will typically apply in the examples and guided practice.\footnote{This technique for degrees of freedom is conservative with respect to a Type~1 Error; it is more difficult to reject the null hypothesis using this $df$ method. In this example, computer software would have provided us a more precise degrees of freedom of $df = 12.225$.}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Distribution of a difference of sample means}
The sample difference of two means, $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$, can be modeled using the $t$-distribution and the standard error
\begin{eqnarray}
\textstyle

\label{seOfDifferenceInMeans}
\end{eqnarray}
when each sample mean can itself be modeled using a $t$-distribution and the samples are independent. To calculate the degrees of freedom, use statistical software or the smaller of $n_1 - 1$ and $n_2 - 1$.}
\end{termBox}\textC{\vspace{-10mm}}

\begin{example}{Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the effect of ESCs on the change in heart pumping capacity of sheep after they've suffered a heart attack.}
We will use the sample difference and the standard error for that point estimate from our earlier calculations:\textC{\vspace{-3mm}}
\begin{align*}
& \bar{x}_{esc} - \bar{x}_{control} = 7.83 \\
& SE = \sqrt{\frac{5.17^2}{9} + \frac{2.76^2}{9}} = 1.95
\end{align*}
Using $df = 8$, we can identify the appropriate $t^{\star}_{df} = t^{\star}_{8}$ for a 95\% confidence interval as 2.31. Finally, we can enter the values into the confidence interval formula:\textC{\vspace{-1mm}}
\begin{align*}
\text{point estimate} \ \pm\ t^{\star}SE \quad\rightarrow\quad
7.83 \ \pm\ 2.31\times 1.95 \quad\rightarrow\quad (3.32, 12.34)
\end{align*}
We are 95\% confident that embryonic stem cells improve the heart's pumping function in sheep that have suffered a heart attack by 3.32\% to 12.34\%.

\subsection{Hypothesis tests based on a difference in means}

\index{data!baby\_smoke|(}

A data set called \data{baby\_\hspace{0.3mm}smoke} represents a random sample of 150 cases of mothers and their newborns in North Carolina over a year. Four cases from this data set are represented in Table~\ref{babySmokeDF}. We are particularly interested in two variables: \var{weight} and \var{smoke}. The \var{weight} variable represents the weights of the newborns and the \var{smoke} variable describes which mothers smoked during pregnancy. We would like to know, is there convincing evidence that newborns from mothers who smoke have a different average birth weight than newborns from mothers who don't smoke? We will use the North Carolina sample to try to answer this question. The smoking group includes 50 cases and the nonsmoking group contains 100 cases, represented in Figure~\ref{babySmokePlotOfTwoGroupsToExamineSkew}.

\begin{table}[h]

\label{babySmokePlotOfTwoGroupsToExamineSkew}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}{Set up appropriate hypotheses to evaluate whether there is a relationship between a mother smoking and average birth weight.}\label{babySmokeHTForWeight}
The null hypothesis represents the case of no difference between the groups.
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] There is no difference in average birth weight for newborns from mothers who did and did not smoke. In statistical notation: $\mu_{n} - \mu_{s} = 0$, where $\mu_{n}$ represents non-smoking mothers and $\mu_s$ represents mothers who smoked.
\item[$H_A$:] There is some difference in average newborn weights from mothers who did and did not smoke ($\mu_{n} - \mu_{s} \neq 0$).
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

We check the two conditions necessary to apply the $t$-distribution to the difference in sample means. (1) Because the data come from a simple random sample and consist of less than 10\% of all such cases, the observations are independent. Additionally, while each distribution is strongly skewed, the sample sizes of 50 and 100 would make it reasonable to model each mean separately using a $t$-distribution. The skew is reasonable for these sample sizes of 50 and 100. (2) The independence reasoning applied in (1) also ensures the observations in each sample are independent. Since both conditions are satisfied, the difference in sample means may be modeled using a $t$-distribution.

%Summary statistics are shown for each sample in Table~\ref{summaryStatsOfBirthWeightForNewbornsFromSmokingAndNonsmokingMothers}.

The summary statistics in Table~\ref{summaryStatsOfBirthWeightForNewbornsFromSmokingAndNonsmokingMothers} may be useful for this exercise. (a)~What is the point estimate of the population difference, $\mu_{n} - \mu_{s}$? (b)~Compute the standard error of the point estimate from part (a).\footnote{(a)~The difference in sample means is an appropriate point estimate: $\bar{x}_{n} - \bar{x}_{s} = 0.40$. (b)~The standard error of the estimate can be estimated using Equation~(\ref{seOfDifferenceInMeans}):
\begin{eqnarray*}
SE = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_n^2}{n_n} + \frac{\sigma_s^2}{n_s}}
	\approx \sqrt{\frac{s_n^2}{n_n} + \frac{s_s^2}{n_s}}

\begin{example}{Draw a picture to represent the p-value for the hypothesis test from Example~\ref{babySmokeHTForWeight}.} \label{pictureOfPValueForEstimateOfDiffOfMeansOfBirthWeights}
To depict the p-value, we draw the distribution of the point estimate as though $H_0$ were true and shade areas representing at least as much evidence against $H_0$ as what was observed. Both tails are shaded because it is a two-sided test.

We start by computing the T-score:
\begin{eqnarray*}
T = \frac{\ 0.40 - 0\ }{0.26} = 1.54
\end{eqnarray*}
Next, we compare this value to values in the $t$-table in Appendix~\vref{tDistributionTable}, where we use the smaller of $n_n - 1 = 99$ and $n_s - 1 = 49$ as the degrees of freedom: $df = 49$. The T-score falls between the first and second columns in the $df = 49$ row of the $t$-table, meaning the two-sided p-value falls between 0.10 and 0.20 (reminder, find tail areas along the top of the table). This p-value is larger than the significance value, 0.05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is insufficient evidence to say there is a difference in average birth weight of newborns from North Carolina mothers who did smoke during pregnancy and newborns from North Carolina mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Does the conclusion to Example~\ref{babySmokeHTForWeightComputePValueAndEvalHT} mean that smoking and average birth weight are unrelated?\footnote{Absolutely not. It is possible that there is some difference but we did not detect it. If there is a difference, we made a Type~2 Error. Notice: we also don't have enough information to, if there is an actual difference, confidently say which direction that difference would be in.}

\subsection{Case study: two versions of a course exam}

\index{data!two exam comparison|(}

An instructor decided to run two slight variations of the same exam. Prior to passing out the exams, she shuffled the exams together to ensure each student received a random version. Summary statistics for how students performed on these two exams are shown in Table~\ref{summaryStatsForTwoVersionsOfExams}. Anticipating complaints from students who took Version~B, she would like to evaluate whether the difference observed in the groups is so large that it provides convincing evidence that Version~B was more difficult (on average) than Version~A.

\begin{table}[hht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l rrrrr}
\hline
Version\hspace{2mm}	& $n$	& $\bar{x}$	& $s$	& min	& max  \\
\hline
A		& 30		& 79.4		& 14 	& 45		& 100 \\
B		& 27		& 74.1		& 20		& 32		& 100 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary statistics of scores for each exam version.}
\label{summaryStatsForTwoVersionsOfExams}
\end{table}

\begin{exercise} \label{htSetupForEvaluatingTwoExamVersions}
Construct a hypotheses to evaluate whether the observed difference in sample means, $\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B=5.3$, is due to chance.\footnote{Because the teacher did not expect one exam to be more difficult prior to examining the test results, she should use a two-sided hypothesis test. $H_0$: the exams are equally difficult, on average. $\mu_A - \mu_B = 0$. $H_A$: one exam was more difficult than the other, on average. $\mu_A - \mu_B \neq 0$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{conditionsForTDistForEvaluatingTwoExamVersions}
To evaluate the hypotheses in Guided Practice~\ref{htSetupForEvaluatingTwoExamVersions} using the $t$-distribution, we must first verify assumptions. (a) Does it seem reasonable that the scores are independent within each group? (b) What about the normality / skew condition for observations in each group? (c) Do you think scores from the two groups would be independent of each other, i.e. the two samples are independent?\footnote{(a) It is probably reasonable to conclude the scores are independent, provided there was no cheating. (b) The summary statistics suggest the data are roughly symmetric about the mean, and it doesn't seem unreasonable to suggest the data might be normal. Note that since these samples are each nearing 30, moderate skew in the data would be acceptable. (c) It seems reasonable to suppose that the samples are independent since the exams were handed out randomly.}
\end{exercise}

After verifying the conditions for each sample and confirming the samples are independent of each other, we are ready to conduct the test using the $t$-distribution. In this case, we are estimating the true difference in average test scores using the sample data, so the point estimate is $\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B = 5.3$. The standard error of the estimate can be calculated~as
\begin{eqnarray*}
SE = \sqrt{\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + \frac{s_B^2}{n_B}} = \sqrt{\frac{14^2}{30} + \frac{20^2}{27}} = 4.62
\end{eqnarray*}
Finally, we construct the test statistic:
\begin{eqnarray*}
T = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE} = \frac{(79.4-74.1) - 0}{4.62} = 1.15
\end{eqnarray*}
If we have a computer handy, we can identify the degrees of freedom as 45.97. Otherwise we use the smaller of $n_1-1$ and $n_2-1$: $df=26$. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.63\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_means/figures/pValueOfTwoTailAreaOfExamVersionsWhereDFIs26/pValueOfTwoTailAreaOfExamVersionsWhereDFIs26}

\label{pValueOfTwoTailAreaOfExamVersionsWhereDFIs26}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}{Identify the p-value using $df = 26$ and provide a conclusion in the context of the case study.}
We examine row $df=26$ in the $t$-table. Because this value is smaller than the value in the left column, the p-value is larger than 0.200 (two tails!). Because the p-value is so large, we do not reject the null hypothesis. That is, the data do not convincingly show that one exam version is more difficult than the other, and the teacher should not be convinced that she should add points to the Version B exam scores.

\index{data!two exam comparison|)}
\end{example}


\subsection{Summary for inference using the $t$-distribution}

%When considering the difference of two means, there are two common cases: the two samples are paired or they are independent. (There are instances where the data are neither paired nor independent, e.g. see blocking in Section~\ref{experimentalDesignPrinciples}.) The paired case was treated in Section~\ref{pairedData}, where the one-sample methods were applied to the differences from the paired observations. We examined the second and more complex scenario in this section.

\textbf{Hypothesis tests.} When applying the $t$-distribution for a hypothesis test, we proceed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Write appropriate hypotheses.
\item Verify conditions for using the $t$-distribution.
\begin{itemize}
\item One-sample or differences from paired data: the observations (or differences) must be independent and nearly normal. For larger sample sizes, we can relax the nearly normal requirement, e.g. slight skew is okay for sample sizes of 15, moderate skew for sample sizes of 30, and strong skew for sample sizes of 60.
\item For a difference of means when the data are not paired: each sample mean must separately satisfy the one-sample conditions for the $t$-distribution, and the data in the groups must also be independent.
\end{itemize}
\item Compute the point estimate of interest, the standard error, and the degrees of freedom. For $df$, use $n-1$ for one sample, and for two samples use either statistical software or the smaller of $n_1 - 1$ and $n_2 - 1$.
\item Compute the T-score and p-value.
\item Make a conclusion based on the p-value, and write a conclusion in context and in plain language so anyone can understand the result.
\end{itemize}
\noindent\textbf{Confidence intervals.} Similarly, the following is how we generally computed a confidence interval using a $t$-distribution:
\begin{itemize}
\item Verify conditions for using the $t$-distribution. (See above.)
\item Compute the point estimate of interest, the standard error, the degrees of freedom, and $t^{\star}_{df}$.
\item Calculate the confidence interval using the general formula, point estimate $\pm\ t_{df}^{\star} SE$.
\item Put the conclusions in context and in plain language so even non-statisticians can understand the results.
\end{itemize}

\CalculatorVideos{confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for a difference of means}


\subsection{Examining the standard error formula (special topic)}

The formula for the standard error of the difference in two means is similar to the formula for other standard errors. Recall that the standard error of a single mean, $\bar{x}_1$, can be approximated by\textC{\vspace{-3mm}}
\begin{align*}
SE_{\bar{x}_1} = \frac{s_1}{\ \sqrt{n_1}\ }
\end{align*}
where $s_1$ and $n_1$ represent the sample standard deviation and sample size.

The standard error of the difference of two sample means can be constructed from the standard errors of the separate sample means:
\begin{eqnarray}
SE_{\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}}
	= \sqrt{SE_{\bar{x}_1}^2 + SE_{\bar{x}_2}^2}
	= \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{{n_1}} + \frac{s_2^2}{{n_2}}}
\label{seOfDiffOfMeansInTermsOfSEOfIndividualMeans}
\end{eqnarray}
This special relationship follows from probability theory.

\begin{exercise}\label{derivingSEForDiffOfTwoMeansExercise}
Prerequisite: Section~\ref{randomVariablesSection}.
We can rewrite Equation~(\ref{seOfDiffOfMeansInTermsOfSEOfIndividualMeans}) in a different way:
\begin{eqnarray*}
SE_{\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}}^2 = SE_{\bar{x}_1}^2 + SE_{\bar{x}_2}^2
\end{eqnarray*}
Explain where this formula comes from using the ideas of probability theory.\footnote{The standard error squared represents the variance of the estimate. If $X$ and $Y$ are two random variables with variances $\sigma_x^2$ and $\sigma_y^2$, then the variance of $X-Y$ is $\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2$. Likewise, the variance corresponding to $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$ is $\sigma_{\bar{x}_1}^2 + \sigma_{\bar{x}_2}^2$. Because $\sigma_{\bar{x}_1}^2$ and $\sigma_{\bar{x}_2}^2$ are just another way of writing $SE_{\bar{x}_1}^2$ and  $SE_{\bar{x}_2}^2$, the variance associated with $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$ may be written as $SE_{\bar{x}_1}^2 + SE_{\bar{x}_2}^2$.}
\end{exercise}


\subsection{Pooled standard deviation estimate (special topic)}
\label{pooledStandardDeviations}

Occasionally, two populations will have standard deviations that are so similar that they can be treated as identical. For example, historical data or a well-understood biological mechanism may justify this strong assumption. In such cases, we can make the $t$-distribution approach slightly more precise by using a pooled standard deviation.

The \term{pooled standard deviation} of two groups is a way to use data from both samples to better estimate the standard deviation and standard error. If $s_1^{}$ and $s_2^{}$ are the standard deviations of groups 1 and 2 and there are good reasons to believe that the population standard deviations are equal, then we can obtain an improved estimate of the group variances by pooling their data:
\begin{align*}
s_{pooled}^2 = \frac{s_1^2\times (n_1-1) + s_2^2\times (n_2-1)}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}
\end{align*}
where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sample sizes, as before. To use this new statistic, we substitute $s_{pooled}^2$ in place of $s_1^2$ and $s_2^2$ in the standard error formula, and we use an updated formula for the degrees of freedom:
\begin{align*}
df = n_1 + n_2 - 2
\end{align*}

The benefits of pooling the standard deviation are realized through obtaining a better estimate of the standard deviation for each group and using a larger degrees of freedom parameter for the $t$-distribution. Both of these changes may permit a more accurate model of the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$, if the standard deviations of the two groups are~equal.

\begin{caution}
{Pool standard deviations only after careful consideration}
{A pooled standard deviation is only appropriate when background research indicates the population standard deviations are nearly equal. When the sample size is large and the condition may be adequately checked with data, the benefits of pooling the standard deviations greatly diminishes.}
\end{caution}

\section[Power calculations for a difference of means (special topic)]{Power calculations for a difference of means\\ (special topic)}
\label{PowerForDifferenceOfTwoMeans}

Often times in experiment planning, there are two competing considerations:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item We want to collect enough data that we can detect important effects.
\item Collecting data can be expensive, and in experiments involving people, there may be some risk to patients.
\end{itemize}
In this section, we focus on the context of a clinical trial, which is a health-related experiment where the subject are people, and we will determine an appropriate sample size where we can be 80\% sure that we would detect any practically important effects.\footnote{Even though we don't cover it explicitly, similar sample size planning is also helpful for observational studies.}


\subsection{Going through the motions of a test}

We're going to go through the motions of a hypothesis test. This will help us frame our calculations for determining an appropriate sample size for the study.

\begin{example}{Suppose a pharmaceutical company has developed a new drug for lowering blood pressure, and they are preparing a clinical trial (experiment) to test the drug's effectiveness. They recruit people who are taking a particular standard blood pressure medication. People in the control group will continue to take their current medication through generic-looking pills to ensure blinding. Write down the hypotheses for a two-sided hypothesis test in this context.}
Generally, clinical trials use a two-sided alternative hypothesis, so below are suitable hypotheses for this context:
\begin{description}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] The new drug performs exactly as well as the standard medication. \\
  $\mu_{trmt} - \mu_{ctrl} = 0$.
\item[$H_A$:] The new drug's performance differs from the standard medication. \\
  $\mu_{trmt} - \mu_{ctrl} \neq 0$.
\end{description}
Some researchers might argue for a one-sided test here, where the alternative would consider only whether the new drug performs better than the standard medication. However, it would be very informative to know whether the new drug performs worse than the standard medication, so we use a two-sided test to consider this possibility during the analysis.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{The researchers would like to run the clinical trial on patients with systolic blood pressures between 140 and 180~mmHg. Suppose previously published studies suggest that the standard deviation of the patients' blood pressures will be about 12~mmHg and the distribution of patient blood pressures will be approximately symmetric.\footnote{In this particular study, we'd generally measure each patient's blood pressure at the beginning and end of the study, and then the outcome measurement for the study would be the average change in blood pressure. That is, both $\mu_{trmt}$ and $\mu_{ctrl}$ would represent average differences. This is what you might think of as a 2-sample paired testing structure, and we'd analyze it exactly just like a hypothesis test for a difference in the average change for patients. In the calculations we perform here, we'll suppose that 12~mmHg is the predicted standard deviation of a patient's blood pressure difference over the course of the study.} If~we had 100 patients per group, what would be the approximate standard error for $\bar{x}_{trmt} - \bar{x}_{ctrl}$?}
The standard error is calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
SE_{\bar{x}_{trmt} - \bar{x}_{ctrl}}
  = \sqrt{\frac{s_{trmt}^2}{n_{trmt}} + \frac{s_{ctrl}^2}{n_{ctrl}}}
  = \sqrt{\frac{12^2}{100} + \frac{12^2}{100}}
  = 1.70
\end{align*}
This may be an imperfect estimate of $SE_{\bar{x}_{trmt} - \bar{x}_{ctrl}}$, since the standard deviation estimate we used may not be correct for this group of patients. However, it is sufficient for our purposes.
\end{example}

\textC{\newpage}

\begin{example}{What does the null distribution of $\bar{x}_{trmt} - \bar{x}_{ctrl}$ look like?}
The degrees of freedom are greater than 30, so the distribution of $\bar{x}_{trmt} - \bar{x}_{ctrl}$ will be approximately normal. The standard deviation of this distribution (the standard error) would be about 1.70, and under the null hypothesis, its mean would be 0.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.93\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_means/figures/power_null_0_1-7/power_null_A_0_1-7}
\end{center}
\end{example}

\begin{example}{For what values of $\bar{x}_{trmt} - \bar{x}_{ctrl}$ would we reject the null hypothesis?}
%If the observed difference is in the far left tail or far right tail of the null distribution, we reject the null hypothesis.
For $\alpha = 0.05$, we would reject $H_0$ if the difference is in the lower 2.5\% or upper 2.5\% tail:
\begin{description}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[Lower 2.5\%:] For the normal model, this is 1.96 standard errors below 0, so any difference smaller than $-1.96 \times 1.70 = -3.332$~mmHg.
\item[Upper 2.5\%:] For the normal model, this is 1.96 standard errors above 0, so any difference larger than $1.96 \times 1.70 = 3.332$~mmHg.
\end{description}
The boundaries of these \term{rejection regions} are shown below:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.93\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_means/figures/power_null_0_1-7/power_null_B_0_1-7_with_rejection_region}
\end{center}
\end{example}

Next, we'll perform some hypothetical calculations to determine the probability we reject the null hypothesis, if the alternative hypothesis were actually true.


\subsection{Computing the power for a 2-sample test}

When planning a study, we want to know how likely we are to detect an effect we care about. In~other words, if there is a real effect, and that effect is large enough that it has practical value, then what's the probability that we detect that effect? This probability is called the \term{power}, and we can compute it for different sample sizes or for different \emph{effect sizes}.

We first determine what is a practically significant result. Suppose that the company researchers care about finding any effect on blood pressure that is 3~mmHg or larger vs the standard medication. Here, 3~mmHg is the minimum \term{effect size} of interest, and we want to know how likely we are to detect this size of an effect in the study.

\begin{example}{Suppose we decided to move forward with 100 patients per treatment group and the new drug reduces blood pressure by an additional 3~mmHg relative to the standard medication. What is the probability that we detect a drop?}\label{PowerFor100AtNeg3}
Before we even do any calculations, notice that if $\bar{x}_{trmt} - \bar{x}_{ctrl} = -3$~mmHg, there wouldn't even be sufficient evidence to reject $H_0$. That's not a good sign.

To calculate the probability that we will reject $H_0$, we need to determine a few things:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item The sampling distribution for $\bar{x}_{trmt} - \bar{x}_{ctrl}$ when the true difference is -3~mmHg. This is the same as the null distribution, except it is shifted to the left by~3:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.87\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_means/figures/power_null_0_1-7/power_null_C_0_1-7_with_alt_at_3}
\end{center}
\item The rejection regions, which are outside of the dotted lines above.
\item The fraction of the distribution that falls in the rejection region.
\end{itemize}
In short, we need to calculate the probability that $x < -3.332$ for a normal distribution with mean -3 and standard deviation~1.7. To do so, we first shade the area we want to calculate:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.93\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_means/figures/power_null_0_1-7/power_null_D_0_1-7_with_alt_at_3_and_shaded}
\end{center}
Then we calculate the Z-score and find the tail area using either the normal probability table or statistical software:
\begin{align*}
Z = \frac{-3.332 - (-3)}{1.7} = -0.20 \qquad \to \qquad 0.4207
\end{align*}
The power for the test is about 42\% when $\mu_{trmt} - \mu_{ctrl} = -3$ and each group has a sample size of 100.
\end{example}

In Example~\ref{PowerFor100AtNeg3}, we ignored the upper rejection region in the calculation, which was in the opposite direction of the hypothetical truth, i.e. -3. The reasoning? There wouldn't be any value in rejecting the null hypothesis and concluding there was an increase when in fact there was a decrease.


\textC{\newpage}


\subsection{Determining a proper sample size}

In the last example, we found that if we have a sample size of 100 in each group, we can only detect an effect size of 3~mmHg with a probability of about 0.42. Suppose the researchers moved forward and only used 100 patients per group, and the data did not support the alternative hypothesis, i.e. the researchers did not reject $H_0$. This is a very bad situation to be in for a few reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item In the back of the researchers' minds, they'd all be wondering, \emph{maybe there is a real and meaningful difference, but we weren't able to detect it with such a small sample}. 
\item The company probably invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing the new drug, so now they are left with great uncertainty about its potential since the experiment didn't have a great shot at detecting effects that could still be important.
\item Patients were subjected to the drug, and we can't even say with much certainty that the drug doesn't help (or harm) patients.
\item Another clinical trial may need to be run to get a more conclusive answer as to whether the drug does hold any practical value, and conducting a second clinical trial may take years and many millions of dollars.
\end{itemize}
We want to avoid this situation, so we need to determine an appropriate sample size to ensure we can be pretty confident that we'll detect any effects that are practically important. As mentioned earlier, a change of 3~mmHg was deemed to be the minimum difference that was practically important. As~a first step, we could calculate power for several different sample sizes. For instance, let's try 500 patients per group.

\begin{exercise}
Calculate the power to detect a change of -3~mmHg when using a sample size of 500 per group.\footnote{(a) The standard error is given as $SE = \sqrt{\frac{12^2}{500} + \frac{12^2}{500}} = 0.76$.\\
(b) \& (c) The null distribution, rejection boundaries, and alternative distribution are shown below: \\
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_means/figures/power_null_0_0-76/power_null_0_0-76_with_alt_at_3_and_shaded} \\
The rejection regions are the areas on the outside of the two dotted lines and are at $\pm 0.76 \times 1.96 = \pm 1.49$. \\
(d) The area of the alternative distribution where $\mu_{trmt} - \mu_{ctrl} = -3$ has been shaded. We compute the Z-score and find the tail area: $Z = \frac{-1.49 - (-3)}{0.76} = 1.99 \to 0.9767$, which is the power of the test for a difference of 3 mmHg. With 500 patients per group, we would be about 97.7\% sure (or more) that we'd detect any effects that are at least 3~mmHg in size.}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Determine the standard error (recall that the standard deviation for patients was expected to be about 12~mmHg).
\item Identify the null distribution and rejection regions.
\item Identify the alternative distribution when $\mu_{trmt} - \mu_{ctrl} = -3$.
\item Compute the probability we reject the null hypothesis.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

The researchers decided 3~mmHg was the minimum difference that was practically important, and with a sample size of 500, we can be very certain (97.7\% or better) that we will detect any such difference. We now have moved to another extreme where we are exposing an unnecessary number of patients to the new drug in the clinical trial. Not only is this ethically questionable, but it would also cost a lot more money than is necessary to be quite sure we'd detect any important effects.

The most common practice is to identify the sample size where the power is around 80\%, and sometimes 90\%. Other values may be reasonable for a specific context, but 80\% and 90\% are most commonly targeted as a good balance between high power and not exposing too many patients to a new treatment (or wasting too much money). We could compute the power of the test at several other possible sample sizes until we find one that's close to 80\%, but that's inefficient. Instead, we should solve the problem backwards.

\begin{example}{What sample size will lead to a power of 80\%?}
We start by identifying the Z-score that would give us a lower tail of 80\%: it would be about 0.84:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.93\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_means/figures/power_best_sample_size/power_best_sample_size}
\end{center}
Additionally, the rejection region always extends $1.96\times SE$ from the center of the null distribution for $\alpha = 0.05$. This allows us to calculate the target distance between the center of the null and alternative distributions in terms of the standard error:
\begin{align*}
0.84 \times SE + 1.96 \times SE = 2.8 \times SE
\end{align*}
In our example, we also want the distance between the null and alternative distributions' centers to equal the minimum effect size of interest, 3~mmHg, which allows us to set up an equation between this difference and the standard error:
\begin{align*}
3 &= 2.8 \times SE \\
3 &= 2.8 \times \sqrt{\frac{12^2}{n} + \frac{12^2}{n}} \\
% 3^2 &= 2.8^2 \times \left( \frac{12^2}{n} + \frac{12^2}{n} \right) \\
n &= \frac{2.8^2}{3^2} \times \left( 12^2 + 12^2 \right) = 250.88 \\
\end{align*}
We should target about 251 patients per group.
\end{example}

The standard error difference of $2.8 \times SE$ is specific to a context where the targeted power is 80\% and the significance level is $\alpha = 0.05$. If the targeted power is 90\% or if we use a difference significance level, then we'll use something a little different than $2.8 \times SE$.

\begin{exercise}
Suppose the targeted power was 90\% and we were using $\alpha = 0.01$. How many standard errors should separate the centers of the null and alternative distribution, where the alternative distribution is centered at the minimum effect size of interest? Assume the test is two-sided.\footnote{First, find the Z-score such that 90\% of the distribution is below it: $Z = 1.28$. Next, find the cutoffs for the rejection regions: $\pm 2.58$. Then the difference in centers should be about $1.28 \times SE + 2.58 \times SE = 3.86 \times SE$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
List some considerations that are important in determining what the power should be for an experiment.\footnote{Answers will vary, but here are a few important considerations:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Whether there is any risk to patients in the study.
\item The cost of enrolling more patients.
\item The potential downside of not detecting an effect of interest.
\end{itemize}}
\end{exercise}

Figure~\ref{power_curve_neg-3} shows the power for sample sizes from 20~patients to 5,000~patients when $\alpha = 0.05$ and the true difference is -3. This curve was constructed by writing a program to compute the power for many different sample sizes.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_means/figures/power_curve/power_curve_neg-3}
\caption{The curve shows the power for different sample sizes in the context of the blood pressure example when the true difference is -3. Having more than about 250 to 350 observations doesn't provide much additional value in detecting an effect when $\alpha = 0.05$.}
\label{power_curve_neg-3}
\end{figure}

Power calculations for expensive or risky experiments are critical. However, what about experiments that are inexpensive and where the ethical considerations are minimal? For example, if we are doing final testing on a new feature on a popular website, how would our sample size considerations change? As before, we'd want to make sure the sample is big enough. However, if the feature has undergone some testing and is known to perform well (i.e. not frustrate many site users), then we may run a much larger experiment than is necessary to detect the minimum effects of interest. The reason is that there may be additional benefits to having an even more precise estimate of the effect of the new feature. We may even conduct a large experiment as part of the rollout of the new feature.

\section[Comparing many means with ANOVA (special topic)]{Comparing many means with ANOVA\\(special topic)}
\label{anovaAndRegrWithCategoricalVariables}

\index{analysis of variance (ANOVA)|(}

Sometimes we want to compare means across many groups. We might initially think to do pairwise comparisons; for example, if there were three groups, we might be tempted to compare the first mean with the second, then with the third, and then finally compare the second and third means for a total of three comparisons. However, this strategy can be treacherous. If we have many groups and do many comparisons, it is likely that we will eventually find a difference just by chance, even if there is no difference in the populations.

In this section, we will learn a new method called \term{analysis of variance (ANOVA)} and a new test statistic called $F$. ANOVA uses a single hypothesis test to check whether the means across many groups are equal:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] The mean outcome is the same across all groups. In statistical notation, $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \cdots = \mu_k$ where $\mu_i$ represents the mean of the outcome for observations in category $i$.
\item[$H_A$:] At least one mean is different.
\end{itemize}
Generally we must check three conditions on the data before performing ANOVA:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item the observations are independent within and across groups,
\item the data within each group are nearly normal, and
\item the variability across the groups is about equal.
\end{itemize}
When these three conditions are met, we may perform an ANOVA to determine whether the data provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis that all the $\mu_i$ are equal.

\begin{example}{College departments commonly run multiple lectures of the same introductory course each semester because of high demand. Consider a statistics department that runs three lectures of an introductory statistics course. We might like to determine whether there are statistically significant differences in first exam scores in these three classes ($A$, $B$, and $C$). Describe appropriate hypotheses to determine whether there are any differences between the three classes.} \label{firstExampleForThreeStatisticsClassesAndANOVA}
The hypotheses may be written in the following form:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] The average score is identical in all lectures. Any observed difference is due to chance. Notationally, we write $\mu_A=\mu_B=\mu_C$.
\item[$H_A$:] The average score varies by class. We would reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis if there were larger differences among the class averages than what we might expect from chance alone.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

Strong evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis in ANOVA is described by unusually large differences among the group means. We will soon learn that assessing the variability of the group means relative to the variability among individual observations within each group is key to ANOVA's success.

\textC{\newpage}

\begin{example}{Examine Figure~\ref{toyANOVA}. Compare groups I, II, and III. Can you visually determine if the differences in the group centers is due to chance or not? Now compare groups IV, V, and VI. Do these differences appear to be due to chance?}

Any real difference in the means of groups I, II, and III is difficult to discern, because the data within each group are very volatile relative to any differences in the average outcome. On the other hand, it appears there are differences in the centers of groups IV, V, and VI. For instance, group V appears to have a higher mean than that of the other two groups. Investigating groups IV, V, and VI, we see the differences in the groups' centers are noticeable because those differences are large \emph{relative to the variability in the individual observations within each group}.
\end{example}

\subsection{Is batting performance related to player position in MLB?}

\index{data!MLB batting|(}

We would like to discern whether there are real differences between the batting performance of baseball players according to their position: outfielder (\resp{OF}), infielder (\resp{IF}), designated hitter (\resp{DH}), and catcher (\resp{C}). We will use a data set called \data{bat10}, which includes batting records of 327 Major League Baseball (MLB) players from the 2010 season. Six of the 327 cases represented in \data{bat10} are shown in Table~\ref{mlbBat10DataMatrix}, and descriptions for each variable are provided in Table~\ref{mlbBat10Variables}. The measure we will use for the player batting performance (the outcome variable) is on-base percentage (\var{OBP}). The on-base percentage roughly represents the fraction of the time a player successfully gets on base or hits a home run.

Why might it be inappropriate to run the test by simply estimating whether the difference of $\mu_{\var{DH}}$ and $\mu_{\resp{C}}$ is statistically significant at a 0.05 significance level?}
\label{multipleComparisonExampleThatIncludesDiscussionOfClassrooms}
The primary issue here is that we are inspecting the data before picking the groups that will be compared. It is inappropriate to examine all data by eye (informal testing) and only afterwards decide which parts to formally test. This is called \term{data snooping} or \term{data fishing}. Naturally we would pick the groups with the large differences for the formal test, leading to an inflation in the Type~1 Error rate. To understand this better, let's consider a slightly different problem.

Suppose we are to measure the aptitude for students in 20 classes in a large elementary school at the beginning of the year. In this school, all students are randomly assigned to classrooms, so any differences we observe between the classes at the start of the year are completely due to chance. However, with so many groups, we will probably observe a few groups that look rather different from each other. If we select only these classes that look so different, we will probably make the wrong conclusion that the assignment wasn't random. While we might only formally test differences for a few pairs of classes, we informally evaluated the other classes by eye before choosing the most extreme cases for a comparison.
\end{example}

For additional information on the ideas expressed in Example~\ref{multipleComparisonExampleThatIncludesDiscussionOfClassrooms}, we recommend reading about the \term{prosecutor's fallacy}.\footnote{See, for example, \oiRedirect{textbook-prosecutors_fallacy}{andrewgelman.com/2007/05/18/the\_prosecutors}.}

In the next section we will learn how to use the $F$ statistic and ANOVA to test whether observed differences in sample means could have happened just by chance even if there was no difference in the respective population means.


\subsection{Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the F test}

The method of analysis of variance in this context focuses on answering one question: is the variability in the sample means so large that it seems unlikely to be from chance alone? This question is different from earlier testing procedures since we will \emph{simultaneously} consider many groups, and evaluate whether their sample means differ more than we would expect from natural variation. We call this variability the \term{mean square between groups ($MSG$)}, and it has an associated degrees of freedom, $df_{G}=k-1$ when there are $k$ groups.\index{degrees of freedom (df)!ANOVA} The $MSG$ can be thought of as a scaled variance formula for means. If the null hypothesis is true, any variation in the sample means is due to chance and shouldn't be too large. Details of $MSG$ calculations are provided in the footnote,\footnote{Let $\bar{x}$ represent the mean of outcomes across all groups. Then the mean square between groups is computed as
\begin{align*}
MSG = \frac{1}{df_{G}}SSG = \frac{1}{k-1}\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_{i}\left(\bar{x}_{i} - \bar{x}\right)^2
\end{align*}
where $SSG$ is called the \term{sum of squares between groups} and $n_{i}$ is the sample size of group $i$.} however, we typically use software for these computations.

The mean square between the groups is, on its own, quite useless in a hypothesis test. We need a benchmark value for how much variability should be expected among the sample means if the null hypothesis is true. To this end, we compute a pooled variance estimate, often abbreviated as the \term{mean square error ($MSE$)}, which has an associated degrees of freedom value $df_E=n-k$. It is helpful to think of $MSE$ as a measure of the variability within the groups. Details of the computations of the $MSE$ are provided in the footnote\footnote{Let $\bar{x}$ represent the mean of outcomes across all groups. Then the \term{sum of squares total ($SST$)} is computed as
\begin{align*}
SST = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(x_{i} - \bar{x}\right)^2
\end{align*}
where the sum is over all observations in the data set. Then we compute the \term{sum of squared errors ($SSE$)} in one of two equivalent ways:
\begin{align*}
SSE &= SST - SSG \\
	&= (n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2 + \cdots + (n_k-1)s_k^2
\end{align*}
where $s_i^2$ is the sample variance (square of the standard deviation) of the residuals in group $i$. Then the $MSE$ is the standardized form of $SSE$: $MSE = \frac{1}{df_{E}}SSE$.} for interested readers.

When the null hypothesis is true, any differences among the sample means are only due to chance, and the $MSG$ and $MSE$ should be about equal. As a test statistic for ANOVA, we examine the fraction of $MSG$ and $MSE$:
\begin{align} \label{formulaForTheFStatistic}
F = \frac{MSG}{MSE}
\end{align}
The $MSG$ represents a measure of the between-group variability, and $MSE$ measures the variability within each of the groups.

\begin{exercise}
For the baseball data, $MSG = 0.00252$ and $MSE=0.00127$. Identify the degrees of freedom associated with MSG and MSE and verify the $F$ statistic is approximately 1.994.\footnote{There are $k=4$ groups, so $df_{G} = k-1 = 3$. There are $n = n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 = 327$ total observations, so $df_{E} = n - k = 323$. Then the $F$ statistic is computed as the ratio of $MSG$ and $MSE$: $F = \frac{MSG}{MSE} = \frac{0.00252}{0.00127} = 1.984 \approx 1.994$. ($F=1.994$ was computed by using values for $MSG$ and $MSE$ that were not rounded.)}
\end{exercise}

We can use the $F$ statistic to evaluate the hypotheses in what is called an \term{F test}. A p-value can be computed from the $F$ statistic using an $F$ distribution, which has two associated parameters: $df_{1}$ and $df_{2}$. For the $F$ statistic in ANOVA, $df_{1} = df_{G}$ and $df_{2}= df_{E}$. An $F$ distribution with 3 and 323 degrees of freedom, corresponding to the $F$ statistic for the baseball hypothesis test, is shown in Figure~\ref{fDist3And323}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_means/figures/fDist3And323/fDist3And323}
\caption{An $F$ distribution with $df_1=3$ and $df_2=323$.}
\label{fDist3And323}
\end{figure}

The larger the observed variability in the sample means ($MSG$) relative to the within-group observations ($MSE$), the larger $F$ will be and the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis. Because larger values of $F$ represent stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, we use the upper tail of the distribution to compute a p-value.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{The $F$ statistic and the $F$ test}
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to test whether the mean outcome differs across 2 or more groups. ANOVA uses a test statistic $F$, which represents a standardized ratio of variability in the sample means relative to the variability within the groups. If $H_0$ is true and the model assumptions are satisfied, the statistic $F$ follows an $F$ distribution with parameters $df_{1}=k-1$ and $df_{2}=n-k$. The upper tail of the $F$ distribution is used to represent the p-value.}
\end{termBox}

\begin{exercise}\label{describePValueAreaForFDistributionInMLBOBPExample}
The test statistic for the baseball example is $F=1.994$. Shade the area corresponding to the p-value in Figure~\ref{fDist3And323}. \footnote{\ \vspace{-4mm}\\\includegraphics[height=20mm]{ch_inference_for_means/figures/fDist3And323/fDist3And323Shaded}}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{The p-value corresponding to the shaded area in the solution of Guided Practice~\ref{describePValueAreaForFDistributionInMLBOBPExample} is equal to about 0.115. Does this provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis?}
The p-value is larger than 0.05, indicating the evidence is not strong enough to reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05. That is, the data do not provide strong evidence that the average on-base percentage varies by player's primary field position.
\end{example}


\subsection{Reading an ANOVA table from software}

The calculations required to perform an ANOVA by hand are tedious and prone to human error. For these reasons, it is common to use statistical software to calculate the $F$ statistic and p-value.

An ANOVA can be summarized in a table very similar to that of a regression summary, which we will see in \MultipleRegressionChapter{Chapters~\ref{linRegrForTwoVar} and~\ref{multipleAndLogisticRegression}}{Chapter~\ref{linRegrForTwoVar}}. Table~\ref{anovaSummaryTableForOBPAgainstPosition} shows an ANOVA summary to test whether the mean of on-base percentage varies by player positions in the MLB. Many of these values should look familiar; in particular, the $F$ test statistic and p-value can be retrieved from the last columns.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}
  \hline
 & Df & Sum Sq & Mean Sq & F value & Pr($>$F) \\ 
  \hline
position & 3 & 0.0076 & 0.0025 & 1.9943 & 0.1147 \\ 
  Residuals & 323 & 0.4080 & 0.0013 &  &  \\    \hline
\multicolumn{6}{r}{$s_{pooled} = 0.036$ on $df=323$}
\end{tabular}
\caption{ANOVA summary for testing whether the average on-base percentage differs across player positions.}
\label{anovaSummaryTableForOBPAgainstPosition}
\end{table}


\subsection{Graphical diagnostics for an ANOVA analysis}

There are three conditions we must check for an ANOVA analysis: all observations must be independent, the data in each group must be nearly normal, and the variance within each group must be approximately equal.

\begin{description}
\item[Independence.] If the data are a simple random sample from less than 10\% of the population, this condition is satisfied. For processes and experiments, carefully consider whether the data may be independent (e.g. no pairing). For example, in the MLB data, the data were not sampled. However, there are not obvious reasons why independence would not hold for most or all observations.
\item[Approximately normal.] As with one- and two-sample testing for means, the normality assumption is especially important when the sample size is quite small. The normal probability plots for each group of the MLB data are shown in Figure~\ref{mlbANOVADiagNormalityGroups}; there is some deviation from normality for infielders, but this isn't a substantial concern since there are about 150 observations in that group and the outliers are not extreme. Sometimes in ANOVA there are so many groups or so few observations per group that checking normality for each group isn't reasonable. See the footnote\footnote{First calculate the \termsub{residuals}{residual} of the baseball data, which are calculated by taking the observed values and subtracting the corresponding group means. For example, an outfielder with OBP of 0.405 would have a residual of $0.405 - \bar{x}_{OF} = 0.071$. Then to check the normality condition, create a normal probability plot using all the residuals simultaneously.} for guidance on how to handle such instances.

\begin{figure}[hhh]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_means/figures/mlbANOVA/mlbANOVADiagNormalityGroups}
\caption{Normal probability plot of OBP for each field position.}
\label{mlbANOVADiagNormalityGroups}
\end{figure}

\item[Constant variance.] The last assumption is that the variance in the groups is about equal from one group to the next. This assumption can be checked by examining a side-by-side box plot of the outcomes across the groups, as in Figure~\vref{mlbANOVABoxPlot}. In this case, the variability is similar in the four groups but not identical. We see in Table~\vref{mlbHRPerABSummaryTable} that the standard deviation varies a bit from one group to the next. Whether these differences are from natural variation is unclear, so we should report this uncertainty with the final results.

\index{data!MLB batting|)}

\end{description}

\begin{caution}
{Diagnostics for an ANOVA analysis}
{Independence is always important to an ANOVA analysis. The normality condition is very important when the sample sizes for each group are relatively small. The constant variance condition is especially important when the sample sizes differ between groups.}
\end{caution}


\subsection{Multiple comparisons and controlling Type~1 Error rate}
\label{multipleComparisonsAndControllingTheType1ErrorRate}

\index{significance level!multiple comparisons|(}

When we reject the null hypothesis in an ANOVA analysis, we might wonder, which of these groups have different means? To answer this question, we compare the means of each possible pair of groups. For instance, if there are three groups and there is strong evidence that there are some differences in the group means, there are three comparisons to make: group 1 to group 2, group 1 to group 3, and group 2 to group 3. These comparisons can be accomplished using a two-sample $t$-test, but we use a modified significance level and a pooled estimate of the standard deviation across groups. Usually this pooled standard deviation can be found in the ANOVA table, e.g. along the bottom of Table~\ref{anovaSummaryTableForOBPAgainstPosition}.

\textC{\newpage}

\begin{example}{Example~\vref{firstExampleForThreeStatisticsClassesAndANOVA} discussed three statistics lectures, all taught during the same semester. Table~\ref{summaryStatisticsForClassTestData} shows summary statistics for these three courses, and a side-by-side box plot of the data is shown in Figure~\ref{classDataSBSBoxPlot}. We would like to conduct an ANOVA for these data. Do you see any deviations from the three conditions for ANOVA?}
In this case (like many others) it is difficult to check independence in a rigorous way. Instead, the best we can do is use common sense to consider reasons the assumption of independence may not hold. For instance, the independence assumption may not be reasonable if there is a star teaching assistant that only half of the students may access; such a scenario would divide a class into two subgroups. No such situations were evident for these particular data, and we believe that independence is acceptable.

The distributions in the side-by-side box plot appear to be roughly symmetric and show no noticeable outliers.

The box plots show approximately equal variability, which can be verified in Table~\ref{summaryStatisticsForClassTestData}, supporting the constant variance assumption.

\end{figure}

\begin{exercise} \label{exerExaminingAnovaSummaryTableForMidtermData}
An ANOVA was conducted for the midterm data, and summary results are shown in Table~\ref{anovaSummaryTableForMidtermData}. What should we conclude?\footnote{The p-value of the test is 0.0330, less than the default significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the difference in the average midterm scores are not due to chance.}
\end{exercise}

  \hline

lecture & 2 & 1290.11 & 645.06 & 3.48 & 0.0330 \\

\label{anovaSummaryTableForMidtermData}
\end{table}

There is strong evidence that the different means in each of the three classes is not simply due to chance. We might wonder, which of the classes are actually different? As discussed in earlier chapters, a two-sample $t$-test could be used to test for differences in each possible pair of groups. However, one pitfall was discussed in Example~\vref{multipleComparisonExampleThatIncludesDiscussionOfClassrooms}: when we run so many tests, the Type~1 Error rate increases. This issue is resolved by using a modified significance level.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Multiple comparisons and the Bonferroni correction for $\alpha$}
The scenario of testing many pairs of groups is called \term{multiple comparisons}. The \term{Bonferroni correction} suggests that a more stringent significance level is more appropriate for these tests:
\begin{align*}
\alpha^* = \alpha / K
\end{align*}
where $K$ is the number of comparisons being considered (formally or informally). If there are $k$ groups, then usually all possible pairs are compared and $K=\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$.}
\end{termBox}

\begin{example}{In Guided Practice~\ref{exerExaminingAnovaSummaryTableForMidtermData}, you found strong evidence of differences in the average midterm grades between the three lectures. Complete the three possible pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni correction and report any differences.} \label{multipleComparisonsOfThreeStatClasses}
We use a modified significance level of $\alpha^* = 0.05/3 = 0.0167$. Additionally, we use the pooled estimate of the standard deviation: $s_{pooled}=13.61$ on $df=161$, which is provided in the ANOVA summary table.

Lecture A versus Lecture B: The estimated difference and standard error are, respectively,
\begin{align*}
\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_{B} &= 75.1 - 72 = 3.1
	&SE = \sqrt{\frac{13.61^2}{58} + \frac{13.61^2}{55}} &= 2.56
\end{align*}
(See Section~\vref{pooledStandardDeviations} for additional details.) This results in a $T$ score of 1.21 on $df = 161$ (we use the $df$ associated with $s_{pooled}$). Statistical software was used to precisely identify the two-sided p-value since the modified significance of 0.0167 is not found in the $t$-table. The p-value (0.228) is larger than $\alpha^*=0.0167$, so there is not strong evidence of a difference in the means of lectures A and B.

Lecture A versus Lecture C: The estimated difference and standard error are 3.8 and 2.61, respectively. This results in a $T$ score of 1.46 on $df = 161$ and a two-sided p-value of 0.1462. This p-value is larger than $\alpha^*$, so there is not strong evidence of a difference in the means of lectures A and C.

Lecture B versus Lecture C: The estimated difference and standard error are 6.9 and 2.65, respectively. This results in a $T$ score of 2.60 on $df = 161$ and a two-sided p-value of 0.0102. This p-value is smaller than $\alpha^*$. Here we find strong evidence of a difference in the means of lectures B and C.
\end{example}

We might summarize the findings of the analysis from Example~\ref{multipleComparisonsOfThreeStatClasses} using the following notation:
\begin{align*}
\mu_A &\stackrel{?}{=} \mu_B
	&\mu_A &\stackrel{?}{=} \mu_C
	&\mu_B &\neq \mu_C
\end{align*}
The midterm mean in lecture A is not statistically distinguishable from those of lectures B or C. However, there is strong evidence that lectures B and C are different. In the first two pairwise comparisons, we did not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Recall that failing to reject $H_0$ does not imply $H_0$ is true.

\begin{caution}
{Sometimes an ANOVA will reject the null but no groups will have statistically significant differences}
{It is possible to reject the null hypothesis using ANOVA and then to not subsequently identify differences in the pairwise comparisons. However, \emph{this does not invalidate the ANOVA conclusion}. It only means we have not been able to successfully identify which groups differ in their means.}
\end{caution}

The ANOVA procedure examines the big picture: it considers all groups simultaneously to decipher whether there is evidence that some difference exists. Even if the test indicates that there is strong evidence of differences in group means, identifying with high confidence a specific difference as statistically significant is more difficult.

Consider the following analogy: we observe a Wall Street firm that makes large quantities of money based on predicting mergers. Mergers are generally difficult to predict, and if the prediction success rate is extremely high, that may be considered sufficiently strong evidence to warrant investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While the SEC may be quite certain that there is insider trading taking place at the firm, the evidence against any single trader may not be very strong. It is only when the SEC considers all the data that they identify the pattern. This is effectively the strategy of ANOVA: stand back and consider all the groups simultaneously.

\eoce{\qt{Diamonds, Part I\label{diamonds_1}} Prices of diamonds are determined by what is 
known as the 4 Cs: cut, clarity, color, and carat weight. The prices of diamonds go up as the 
carat weight increases, but the increase is not smooth. For example, the difference between the 
size of a 0.99 carat diamond and a 1 carat diamond is undetectable to the naked human eye, but 
the price of a 1 carat diamond tends to be much higher than the price of a 0.99 diamond. In 
this question we use two random samples of diamonds, 0.99 carats and 1 carat, each sample of 
size 23, and compare the average prices of the diamonds. In order to be able to compare 
equivalent units, we first divide the price for each diamond by 100 times its weight in carats. 
That is, for a 0.99 carat diamond, we divide the price by 99. For a 1 carat diamond, we divide 
the price by 100. The distributions and some sample statistics are shown below.

This score measures a person's need for control or their rebellion against control, and it is 
part of a commonly used mental health test called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality

\eoce{\qt{Increasing corn yield\label{increase_corn_yield}} A large farm wants to try out a new 
type of fertilizer to evaluate whether it will improve the farm's corn production. The land is 
broken into plots that produce an average of 1,215 pounds of corn with a standard deviation of 
94 pounds per plot. The owner is interested in detecting any average difference of at least 40 
pounds per plot. How many plots of land would be needed for the experiment if the desired power 
level is 90\%? Assume each plot of land gets treated with either the current fertilizer or the 
new fertilizer.

\eoce{\qt{Email outreach efforts\label{email_outreach_efforts}} A medical research group is 
recruiting people to complete short surveys about their medical history. For example, one 
survey asks for information on a person's family history in regards to cancer. Another survey 
asks about what topics were discussed during the person's last visit to a hospital. So far, as 
people sign up, they complete an average of just 4~surveys, and the standard deviation of the 
number of surveys is about~2.2. The research group wants to try a new interface that they think 
will encourage new enrollees to complete more surveys, where they will randomize each enrollee 
to either get the new interface or the current interface. How many new enrollees do they need 
for each interface to detect an effect size of 0.5 surveys per enrollee, if the desired power 
level is 80\%?

\chapter{Inference for categorical data}
\label{inferenceForCategoricalData}

Chapter~\ref{inferenceForCategoricalData} introduces inference in the setting of categorical data. We use these methods to answer questions like the following:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item What proportion of the American public approves of the job the Supreme Court is doing?
\item The Pew Research Center conducted a poll about support for the 2010 health care law, and they used two forms of the survey question. Each respondent was randomly given one of the two questions. What is the difference in the support for respondents under the two question orderings?
\end{itemize}
The methods we learned in previous chapters will continue to be useful in these settings. For example, sample proportions are well characterized by a nearly normal distribution when certain conditions are satisfied, making it possible to employ the usual confidence interval and hypothesis testing tools. In other instances, such as those with contingency tables or when sample size conditions are not met, we will use a different distribution, though the core ideas remain the same.

\section{Inference for a single proportion}
\label{singleProportion}

\index{data!Ebola poll|(}

In New York City on October 23rd, 2014, a doctor who had recently been treating Ebola patients in Guinea went to the hospital with a slight fever and was subsequently diagnosed with Ebola. Soon thereafter, an NBC 4 New York/The Wall Street Journal/Marist Poll found that 82\% of New Yorkers favored a ``mandatory 21-day quarantine for anyone who has come in contact with an Ebola patient''.\footnote{\oiRedirect{textbook-maristpoll_ebola_201410}{Poll ID NY141026 on maristpoll.marist.edu}.} This poll included responses of 1,042 New York adults between October 26th and 28th, 2014.


\textC{\newpage}


\subsection{Identifying when the sample proportion is nearly normal}

A sample proportion can be described as a sample mean. If we represent each ``success'' as a 1 and each ``failure'' as a 0, then the sample proportion is the mean of these numerical outcomes:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{p} = \frac{\ 0 + 1 + 1 + \cdots + 0\ }{1042} = 0.82
\end{eqnarray*}
The distribution of $\hat{p}$ is nearly normal when the distribution of 0's and 1's is not too strongly skewed for the sample size. The most common guideline for sample size and skew when working with proportions is to ensure that we expect to observe a minimum number of successes (1's) and failures (0's), typically at least 10 of each. The labels \term{success} and \term{failure} need not mean something positive or negative. These terms are just convenient words that are frequently used when discussing proportions.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Conditions for the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ being nearly normal}
The sampling distribution for $\hat{p}$, taken from a sample of size $n$ from a population with a true proportion $p$, is nearly normal when
\begin{enumerate}
\item the sample observations are independent and
\item we expected to see at least 10 successes and 10 failures in our sample, i.e. $np\geq10$ and $n(1-p)\geq10$. This is called the \term{success-failure condition}.
\end{enumerate}
If these conditions are met, then the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ is nearly normal with mean $p$ and standard error
\index{standard error (SE)!single proportion}
\begin{eqnarray}
SE_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{\ p(1-p)\ }{n}}
\label{seOfPHat}
\end{eqnarray}}
\end{termBox}\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-53mm}

$\hat{p}$\vspace{0mm}\\\footnotesize sample\\proportion\vspace{3mm}\\\normalsize$p$\vspace{0mm}\\\footnotesize population\\proportion]{\raggedright\vspace{-53mm}

$\hat{p}$\vspace{0mm}\\\footnotesize sample\\proportion\vspace{3mm}\\\normalsize$p$\vspace{0mm}\\\footnotesize population\\proportion}

Typically we don't know the true proportion, $p$, so we substitute some value to check conditions and to estimate the standard error. For confidence intervals, usually the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ is used to check the success-failure condition and compute the standard error. For hypothesis tests, typically the null value -- that is, the proportion claimed in the null hypothesis -- is used in place of $p$. Examples are presented for each of these cases in Sections~\ref{confIntForPropSection} and~\ref{htForPropSection}.

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Reminder on checking independence of observations}
If data come from a simple random sample and consist of less than 10\% of the population, then the independence assumption is reasonable. Alternatively, if the data come from a random process, we must evaluate the independence condition more carefully.}
\end{tipBox}


\textC{\newpage}


\subsection{Confidence intervals for a proportion}
\label{confIntForPropSection}

\index{point estimate!single proportion}

We may want a confidence interval for the proportion of New York adults who favored a mandatory quarantine of anyone who had been in contact with an Ebola patient. Our point estimate, based on a sample of size $n = 1042$, is $\hat{p} = 0.82$. We would like to use the general confidence interval formula from Section~\ref{aFrameworkForInference}. However, first we must verify that the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ is nearly normal and calculate the standard error of $\hat{p}$.
\begin{description}
\item[Observations are independent.] The poll is based on a simple random sample and consists of fewer than 10\% of the New York adult population, which verifies independence.
\item[Success-failure condition.] The sample size must also be sufficiently large, which is checked using the \hiddenterm{success-failure condition}. There were $1042 \times \hat{p} \approx 854$ ``successes'' and $1042 \times (1 - \hat{p}) \approx 188$ ``failures'' in the sample, both easily greater than~10.
\end{description}
With the conditions met, we are assured that the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ is nearly normal. Next, a standard error for $\hat{p}$ is needed, and then we can employ the usual method to construct a confidence interval.

\begin{exercise} \label{seOfPropOfAmericansJobApprovalOfSupremeCourt}
Estimate the standard error of $\hat{p} = 0.82$ using Equation~\eqref{seOfPHat}. Because $p$ is unknown and the standard error is for a confidence interval, use $\hat{p}$ in place of $p$ in the formula.\footnote{$SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{0.82 (1 - 0.82)}{1042}} = 0.012$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{Construct a 95\% confidence interval for $p$, the proportion of New York adults who supported a quarantine for anyone who has come into contact with an Ebola patient.}
Using the standard error $SE = 0.012$ from Guided Practice~\ref{seOfPropOfAmericansJobApprovalOfSupremeCourt}, the point estimate 0.82, and $z^{\star} = 1.96$ for a 95\% confidence interval, the confidence interval is
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{point estimate} \ \pm\ z^{\star}SE \quad\to\quad 0.82 \ \pm\ 1.96\times 0.012 \quad\to\quad (0.796, 0.844)
\end{eqnarray*}
We are 95\% confident that the true proportion of New York adults in October 2014 who supported a quarantine for anyone who had come into contact with an Ebola patient was between 0.796 and 0.844.

\index{data!Ebola poll|)}

\end{example}

Notice that since the poll was around the time where a doctor in New York had come down with Ebola, the results may not be as applicable today as they were at the time the poll was taken. This highlights an important detail about polls: they provide data about public opinion at a single point in time.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle[]{Constructing a confidence interval for a proportion}\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Verify the observations are independent and also verify the success-failure condition using $\hat{p}$ and $n$.
\item If the conditions are met, the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ may be well-approximated by the normal model.
\item Construct the standard error using $\hat{p}$ in place of $p$ and apply the general confidence interval formula.\vspace{1mm}
\end{itemize}}
\end{termBox}


\subsection{Hypothesis testing for a proportion}
\label{htForPropSection}

To apply the normal distribution framework in the context of a hypothesis test for a proportion, the independence and success-failure conditions must be satisfied. In a hypothesis test, the success-failure condition is checked using the null proportion: we verify $np_0$ and $n(1-p_0)$ are at least 10, where $p_0$ is the null value.

\index{data!nuclear arms reduction|(}

\begin{exercise}
Do a majority of American support nuclear arms reduction? Set up a one-sided hypothesis test to evaluate this question.\footnote{$H_0: p = 0.50$. $H_A: p > 0.50$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{A simple random sample of 1,028 US adults in March 2013 found that 56\% support nuclear arms reduction.\footnote{\oiRedirect{textbook-nuclear_arms_reduction_201303}{www.gallup.com/poll/161198/favor-russian-nuclear-arms-reductions.aspx}} Does this provide convincing evidence that a majority of Americans supported nuclear arms reduction at the 5\% significance level?} \label{NuclearArmsInferenceExample}
The poll was of a simple random sample that includes fewer than 10\% of US adults, meaning the observations are independent. In a one-proportion hypothesis test, the success-failure condition is checked using the null proportion, which is $p_0 = 0.5$ in this context: $n p_0 = n (1 - p_0) = 1028 \times 0.5 = 514 > 10$. With these conditions verified, the normal model may be applied to $\hat{p}$.

Next the standard error can be computed. The null value $p_0$ is used again here, because this is a hypothesis test for a single proportion.
\begin{align*}
SE = \sqrt{\frac{p_0 (1 - p_0)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.5 (1 - 0.5)}{1028}} = 0.016
\end{align*}
A picture of the normal model is shown in Figure~\ref{nuclearArmsReductionPValue} with the p-value represented by the shaded region. Based on the normal model, the test statistic can be computed as the Z-score of the point estimate:
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}
The upper tail area, representing the p-value, is about 0.0001. Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject $H_0$. The poll provides convincing evidence that a majority of Americans supported nuclear arms reduction efforts in March 2013.

\subsection{Choosing a sample size when estimating a proportion}

\index{margin of error|(}

When collecting data, we choose a sample size suitable for the purpose of the study. Often times this means choosing a sample size large enough that the \term{margin of error} -- which is the part we add and subtract from the point estimate in a confidence interval -- is sufficiently small that the sample is useful. More explicitly, our task is to find a sample size $n$ so that the sample proportion is within some margin of error $m$ of the actual proportion with a certain level of confidence.

% For example, the margin of error for a point estimate using 95\% confidence can be written as $1.96\times SE$. We set up a general equation to represent the problem:
%\begin{align*}
%ME = z^{\star}SE \leq m
%\end{align*}
%where $ME$ represented the actual margin of error and $z^{\star}$ was chosen to correspond to the confidence level. The standard error formula is specified to correspond to the particular setting. For instance, in the case of means, the standard error was given as $\sigma / \sqrt{n}$. In the case of a single proportion, we use $\sqrt{p(1-p) / n\ }$ for the standard error.

\begin{example}{A university newspaper is conducting a survey to determine what fraction of students support a \$200 per year increase in fees to pay for a new football stadium. How big of a sample is required to ensure the margin of error is smaller than 0.04 using a 95\% confidence level?}
The margin of error for a sample proportion is
\begin{align*}
z^{\star} \sqrt{\frac{p (1 - p)}{n}}
\end{align*}
Our goal is to find the smallest sample size $n$ so that this margin of error is smaller than $m=0.04$. For a 95\% confidence level, the value $z^{\star}$ corresponds to 1.96:
\begin{align*}
1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \ < \ 0.04
\end{align*}
There are two unknowns in the equation: $p$ and $n$. If we have an estimate of $p$, perhaps from a similar survey, we could enter in that value and solve for $n$. If we have no such estimate, we must use some other value for $p$. It turns out that the margin of error is largest when $p$ is 0.5, so we typically use this \emph{worst case value} if no estimate of the proportion is available:
\begin{align*}
	1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{n}} &\ < \ 0.04 \\
	1.96^2\times \frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{n} &\ < \ 0.04^2 \\
	1.96^2\times \frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{0.04^2} &\ < \ n \\
	600.25 &\ < \  n
\end{align*}
We would need over 600.25 participants, which means we need 601 participants or more, to ensure the sample proportion is within 0.04 of the true proportion with 95\% confidence.
\end{example}

When an estimate of the proportion is available, we use it in place of the worst case proportion value,~0.5.

\begin{example}{A manager is about to oversee the mass production of a new tire model in her factory, and she would like to estimate what proportion of these tires will be rejected through quality control. The quality control team has monitored the last three tire models produced by the factory, failing 1.7\% of tires in the first model, 6.2\% of the second model, and 1.3\% of the third model. The manager would like to examine enough tires to estimate the failure rate of the new tire model to within about 2\% with a 90\% confidence level.
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[(a)] There are three different failure rates to choose from. Perform the sample size computation for each separately, and identify three sample sizes to consider.
\item[(b)] The sample sizes vary widely. Which of the three would you suggest using? What would influence your choice?
\end{enumerate}}
(a)~For a 90\% confidence interval, $z^{\star} = 1.65$, and since an estimate of the proportion 0.017 is available, we'll use it in the margin of error formula: %use theFor the 1.7\% estimate of $p$, we estimate the appropriate sample size as follows:
\begin{align*}
1.65\times \sqrt{\frac{0.017(1-0.017)}{n}} &\ < \ 0.02 \\
113.7 &\ < \ n
\end{align*}
For sample size calculations, we always round up, so the first tire model suggests 114 tires would be sufficient.

A similar computation can be accomplished using 0.062 and 0.013 for $p$, and you should verify that using these proportions results in minimum sample sizes of 396 and~88 tires, respectively.

(b) We could examine which of the old models is most like the new model, then choose the corresponding sample size. Or if two of the previous estimates are based on small samples while the other is based on a larger sample, we should consider the value corresponding to the larger sample. There are also other reasonable approaches.

It should also be noted that the success-failure condition is not met with $n = 114$ or $n = 88$. That is, we would need additional methods than what we've covered so far to analyze results based on those sample sizes.

\begin{align*}
1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \approx
1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{0.19(1-0.19)}{n}} &\leq 0.04 \qquad\to\qquad n \geq 369.5

\section{Difference of two proportions}
\label{differenceOfTwoProportions}

We would like to make conclusions about the difference in two population proportions: \mbox{$p_1 - p_2$}. We consider three examples. In the first, we compare the approval of the 2010 healthcare law under two different question phrasings. In the second application, we examine the efficacy of mammograms in reducing deaths from breast cancer. In the last example, a quadcopter company weighs whether to switch to a higher quality manufacturer of rotor blades.

In our investigations, we first identify a reasonable point estimate of $p_1 - p_2$ based on the sample. You may have already guessed its form: $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$\index{point estimate!difference of proportions}. Next, in each example we verify that the point estimate follows the normal model by checking certain conditions. Finally, we compute the estimate's standard error and apply our inferential framework.


\subsection{Sample distribution of the difference of two proportions}

We must check two conditions before applying the normal model to $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$. First, the sampling distribution for each sample proportion must be nearly normal, and secondly, the samples must be independent. Under these two conditions, the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ may be well approximated using the normal model.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Conditions for the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ to be normal}
The difference $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ tends to follow a normal model when
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item each proportion separately follows a normal model, and
\item the two samples are independent of each other.
\end{itemize}
The standard error of the difference in sample proportions is
\index{standard error (SE)!difference in proportions}
\begin{eqnarray}
SE_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2}
	= \sqrt{SE_{\hat{p}_1}^2 + SE_{\hat{p}_2}^2}
	= \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}
\label{seForDiffOfProp}
\end{eqnarray}
where $p_1$ and $p_2$ represent the population proportions, and $n_1$ and $n_2$ represent the sample sizes.}
\end{termBox}

For the difference in two means, the standard error formula took the following form:
\begin{eqnarray*}
SE_{\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}} = \sqrt{SE_{\bar{x}_1}^2 + SE_{\bar{x}_2}^2}
\end{eqnarray*}
The standard error for the difference in two proportions takes a similar form. The reasons behind this similarity are rooted in the probability theory of Section~\ref{randomVariablesSection}, which is described for this context in Guided Practice~\vref{derivingSEForDiffOfTwoMeansExercise}.


\subsection{Confidence intervals for $p_1 -p_2$}

In the setting of confidence intervals for a difference of two proportions, the two sample proportions are used to verify the success-failure condition and also compute the standard error, just as was the case with a single proportion.

\begin{example}{The way a question is phrased can influence a person's response. For example, Pew Research Center conducted a survey with the following question:\footnote{\oiRedirect{textbook-health_care_bill_2012}{www.people-press.org/2012/03/26/public-remains-split-on-health-care-bill-opposed-to-mandate}. Sample sizes for each polling group are approximate.}
\begin{quote}
As you may know, by 2014 nearly all Americans will be required to have health insurance. [People who do not buy insurance will pay a penalty] while [People who cannot afford it will receive financial help from the government]. Do you approve or disapprove of this policy?
\end{quote}
\index{data!health care|(}For each randomly sampled respondent, the statements in brackets were randomized: either they were kept in the order given above, or the two statements were reversed. Table~\ref{pewPollResultsForRandomizedStatementOrdering} shows the results of this experiment. Create and interpret a 90\% confidence interval of the difference in approval.}

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{p{50mm}c p{13mm}p{14mm}p{16.5mm}c}
	&\ & Sample size ($n_i$) & Approve law (\%)	& Disapprove law (\%)	& Other \\
\hline
``people who cannot afford it will receive financial help from the government'' is given second \vspace{2.5mm}
	& & 771	& 47	& 49	& 3 \\
``people who do not buy it will pay a penalty'' is given second
	& & 732	& 34	& 63	& 3 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Results for a Pew Research Center poll where the ordering of two statements in a question regarding healthcare were randomized.\vspaceB{-2mm}}
\label{pewPollResultsForRandomizedStatementOrdering}
\end{table}

First the conditions must be verified. Because each group is a simple random sample from less than 10\% of the population, the observations are independent, both within the samples and between the samples. The success-failure condition also holds for each sample. Because all conditions are met, the normal model can be used for the point estimate of the difference in support, where $p_1$ corresponds to the original ordering and $p_2$ to the reversed ordering:
$$\hat{p}_{1} - \hat{p}_{2} = 0.47 - 0.34 = 0.13$$
The standard error may be computed from Equation~\eqref{seForDiffOfProp} using the sample proportions:
$$SE \approx \sqrt{\frac{0.47(1-0.47)}{771} + \frac{0.34(1-0.34)}{732}} = 0.025$$
For a 90\% confidence interval, we use $z^{\star} = 1.65$:
$$\text{point estimate} \ \pm\ z^{\star}SE \quad \to \quad 0.13 \ \pm\ 1.65 \times  0.025 \quad \to \quad (0.09, 0.17)$$
We are 90\% confident that the approval rating for the 2010 healthcare law changes between 9\% and 17\% due to the ordering of the two statements in the survey question. The Pew Research Center reported that this modestly large difference suggests that the opinions of much of the public are still fluid on the health insurance mandate.

\subsection{Hypothesis tests for $p_1 -p_2$}

\index{data!mammography|(}
\index{data!breast cancer|(}

A mammogram is an X-ray procedure used to check for breast cancer. Whether mammograms should be used is part of a controversial discussion, and it's the topic of our next example where we examine 2-proportion hypothesis test when $H_0$~is~$p_1 - p_2 = 0$ (or equivalently, $p_1 = p_2$).

A 30-year study was conducted with nearly 90,000 female participants.\footnote{\oiRedirect{textbook-90k_mammogram_study_2014}{Miller AB. 2014. \emph{Twenty five year follow-up for breast cancer incidence and mortality of the Canadian National Breast Screening Study: randomised screening trial}. BMJ 2014;348:g366.}} During a 5-year screening period, each woman was randomized to one of two groups: in the first group, women received regular mammograms to screen for breast cancer, and in the second group, women received regular non-mammogram breast cancer exams. No intervention was made during the following 25 years of the study, and we'll consider death resulting from breast cancer over the full 30-year period. Results from the study are summarized in Table~\ref{mammogramStudySummaryTable}.

If mammograms are much more effective than non-mammogram breast cancer exams, then we would expect to see additional deaths from breast cancer in the control group. On~the other hand, if mammograms are not as effective as regular breast cancer exams, we~would expect to see an increase in breast cancer deaths in the mammogram group.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrcc}
	& \multicolumn{3}{c}{Death from breast cancer?} \\
  \cline{2-4}
 & \ \hspace{3mm}\ & Yes & No \\

Control && 505 & 44,405 \\
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary results for breast cancer study.}
\label{mammogramStudySummaryTable}
\end{table}

\begin{exercise}
Is this study an experiment or an observational study?\footnote{This is an experiment. Patients were randomized to receive mammograms or a standard breast cancer exam. We will be able to make causal conclusions based on this study.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{htFormammogramStudySummaryTable}
Set up hypotheses to test whether there was a difference in breast cancer deaths in the mammogram and control groups.\footnote{$H_0$: the breast cancer death rate for patients screened using mammograms is the same as the breast cancer death rate for patients in the control, $p_{mgm} - p_{ctrl} = 0$. \\ $H_A$: the breast cancer death rate for patients screened using mammograms is different than the breast cancer death rate for patients in the control, $p_{mgm} - p_{ctrl} \neq 0$.}
\end{exercise}

In Example~\ref{condFormammogramStudySummaryTableNormalInference}, we will check the conditions for using the normal model to analyze the results of the study. The details are very similar to that of confidence intervals. However, this time we use a special proportion called the \term{pooled proportion} to check the success-failure condition:
\begin{align*}
\hat{p} &= \frac{\text{\# of patients who died from breast cancer in the entire study}}{\text{\# of patients in the entire study}} \\
	&= \frac{500 + 505}{500 + \text{44,425} + 505 + \text{44,405}} \\
	&= 0.0112
\end{align*}
This proportion is an estimate of the breast cancer death rate across the entire study, and it's our best estimate of the proportions $p_{mgm}$ and $p_{ctrl}$ \emph{if the null hypothesis is true that $p_{mgm} = p_{ctrl}$}. We will also use this pooled proportion when computing the standard error.

\begin{example}{Can we use the normal model to analyze this study?}\label{condFormammogramStudySummaryTableNormalInference}
Because the patients are randomized, they can be treated as independent.

We also must check the success-failure condition for each group. Under the null hypothesis, the proportions $p_{mgm}$ and $p_{ctrl}$ are equal, so we check the success-failure condition with our best estimate of these values under $H_0$, the \hiddenterm{pooled proportion} from the two samples, $\hat{p} = 0.0112$:
\begin{align*}
\hat{p} \times n_{mgm} &= 0.0112 \times \text{44,925} = 503
	& (1 - \hat{p}) \times n_{mgm} &= 0.9888 \times \text{44,925} = \text{44,422} \\
\hat{p} \times n_{ctrl} &= 0.0112 \times \text{44,910} = 503
	& (1 - \hat{p}) \times n_{ctrl} &= 0.9888 \times \text{44,910} = \text{44,407}
\end{align*}
The success-failure condition is satisfied since all values are at least 10, and we can safely apply the normal model.
\end{example}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Use the pooled proportion estimate when $\mathbf{H_0}$ is $\mathbf{p_1 - p_2 = 0}$}
When the null hypothesis is that the proportions are equal, use the pooled proportion ($\hat{p}$) to verify the success-failure condition and estimate the standard error:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{p} = \frac{\text{number of ``successes''}}{\text{number of cases}} = \frac{\hat{p}_1n_1 + \hat{p}_2n_2}{n_1 + n_2}
\end{eqnarray*}
Here $\hat{p}_1n_1$ represents the number of successes in sample 1 since
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{p}_1 = \frac{\text{number of successes in sample 1}}{n_1}
\end{eqnarray*}
Similarly, $\hat{p}_2n_2$ represents the number of successes in sample 2.}
\end{termBox}

In Example~\ref{condFormammogramStudySummaryTableNormalInference}, the pooled proportion was used to check the success-failure condition. In the next example, we see the second place where the pooled proportion comes into play: the standard error calculation.

\begin{example}{Compute the point estimate of the difference in breast cancer death rates in the two groups, and use the pooled proportion $\hat{p} = 0.0112$ to calculate the standard error.}
The point estimate of the difference in breast cancer death rates is
\begin{align*}
\hat{p}_{mgm} - \hat{p}_{ctrl}
	&= \frac{500}{500 + 44,425} - \frac{505}{505 + 44,405} \\
	&= 0.01113 - 0.01125 \\
	&= -0.00012
\end{align*}
The breast cancer death rate in the mammogram group was 0.012\% less than in the control group. Next, the standard error is calculated \emph{using the pooled proportion},~$\hat{p}$:
\begin{align*}
SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n_{mgm}}
		+ \frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n_{ctrl}}}
	= 0.00070
\end{align*}
\end{example}

\begin{example}{Using the point estimate $\hat{p}_{mgm} - \hat{p}_{ctrl} = -0.00012$ and standard error $SE = 0.00070$, calculate a p-value for the hypothesis test and write a conclusion.}
Just like in past tests, we first compute a test statistic and draw a picture:
\begin{align*}
Z = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE}
	= \frac{-0.00012 - 0}{0.00070}
	= -0.17
\end{align*}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_props/figures/mammograms/mammogramPValue}
\end{center}
The lower tail area is 0.4325, which we double to get the p-value:~0.8650. Because this p-value is larger than 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis. That is, the difference in breast cancer death rates is reasonably explained by chance, and we do not observe benefits or harm from mammograms relative to a regular breast exam.
\end{example}

Can we conclude that mammograms have no benefits or harm? Here are a few important considerations to keep in mind when reviewing the mammogram study as well as any other medical study:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item If mammograms are helpful or harmful, the data suggest the effect isn't very large. So while we do not accept the null hypothesis, we also don't have sufficient evidence to conclude that mammograms reduce or increase breast cancer deaths.
\item Are mammograms more or less expensive than a non-mammogram breast exam? If~one option is much more expensive than the other and doesn't offer clear benefits, then we should lean towards the less expensive option.
\item The study's authors also found that mammograms led to overdiagnosis of breast cancer, which means some breast cancers were found (or thought to be found) but that these cancers would not cause symptoms during patients' lifetimes. That is, something else would kill the patient before breast cancer symptoms appeared. This means some patients may have been treated for breast cancer unnecessarily, and this treatment is another cost to consider. It is also important to recognize that overdiagnosis can cause unnecessary physical or emotional harm to patients.
\end{itemize}
These considerations highlight the complexity around medical care and treatment recommendations. Experts and medical boards who study medical treatments use considerations like those above to provide their best recommendation based on the current evidence.

\subsection{More on 2-proportion hypothesis tests (special topic)}

When we conduct a 2-proportion hypothesis test, usually $H_0$ is $p_1 - p_2 = 0$. However, there are rare situations where we want to check for some difference in $p_1$ and $p_2$ that is some value other than 0. For example, maybe we care about checking a null hypothesis where $p_1 - p_2 = 0.1$.\footnote{We can also encounter a similar situation with a difference of two means, though no such example was given in Chapter~\ref{inferenceForNumericalData} since the methods remain exactly the same in the context of sample means. On the other hand, the success-failure condition and the calculation of the standard error vary slightly in different proportion contexts.} In contexts like these, we generally use $\hat{p}_1$ and $\hat{p}_2$ to check the success-failure condition and construct the standard error.

\begin{exercise}\label{carWheelBladeManufacturer}
A quadcopter company is considering a new manufacturer for rotor blades. The new manufacturer would be more expensive but their higher-quality blades are more reliable, resulting in happier customers and fewer warranty claims. However, management must be convinced that the more expensive blades are worth the conversion before they approve the switch. If there is strong evidence of a more than 3\% improvement in the percent of blades that pass inspection, management says they will switch suppliers, otherwise they will maintain the current supplier. Set up appropriate hypotheses for the test.\footnote{$H_0$: The higher-quality blades will pass inspection just 3\% more frequently than the standard-quality blades. $p_{highQ} - p_{standard} = 0.03$. $H_A$: The higher-quality blades will pass inspection $>$3\% more often than the standard-quality blades. $p_{highQ} - p_{standard} > 0.03$.}

%\Add{In Guided Practice~\ref{qualityCtrlEngHypothesisEval}, the null difference is 0.03. However, in the vast majority of applications for differences in means or proportions, the null difference is~0. While the details for a difference of means does not change if the null difference is zero or non-zero, that is not the case for a difference in proportions. As we'll see in Section~\ref{}, a hypothesis test for a difference in proportions where the null value is 0 requires additional~care.}

\begin{example}{The quality control engineer from Guided Practice~\ref{carWheelBladeManufacturer} collects a sample of blades, examining 1000 blades from each company and finds that 899 blades pass inspection from the current supplier and 958 pass inspection from the prospective supplier. Using these data, evaluate the hypothesis setup of Guided Practice~\ref{carWheelBladeManufacturer} with a significance level of 5\%.}\label{qualityCtrlEngHypothesisEval}
First, we check the conditions. The sample is not necessarily random, so to proceed we must assume the blades are all independent; for this sample we will suppose this assumption is reasonable, but the engineer would be more knowledgeable as to whether this assumption is appropriate. The success-failure condition also holds for each sample. Thus, the difference in sample proportions, $0.958 - 0.899 = 0.059$, can be said to come from a nearly normal distribution.

The standard error is computed using the two sample proportions since we do not use a pooled proportion for this context:
\begin{align*}
SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.958(1-0.958)}{1000} + \frac{0.899(1-0.899)}{1000}} = 0.0114
\end{align*}
In this hypothesis test, because the null is that $p_1 - p_2 = 0.03$, the sample proportions were used for the standard error calculation rather than a pooled proportion.

Next, we compute the test statistic and use it to find the p-value, which is depicted in Figure~\ref{bladesTwoSampleHTPValueQC}.
$$Z = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE} = \frac{0.059 - 0.03}{0.0114} = 2.54$$
Using the normal model for this test statistic, we identify the right tail area as 0.006. Since this is a one-sided test, this single tail area is also the p-value, and we reject the null hypothesis because 0.006 is less than 0.05. That is, we have statistically significant evidence that the higher-quality blades actually do pass inspection more than 3\% as often as the currently used blades. Based on these results, management will approve the switch to the new supplier.
\end{example}

%, even large ones, are difficult to detect with small samples, so we should want to collect a larger sample to detect such effects. If we take a very large sample, we might find a statistically significant difference but the magnitude might be so small that it is of no practical value. In this section we describe techniques for selecting an appropriate sample size based on these considerations.

\section[Testing for goodness of fit using chi-square (special topic)]{Testing for goodness of fit using chi-square \\(special topic)}
\label{oneWayChiSquare}

In this section, we develop a method for assessing a null model when the data are binned.
This technique is commonly used in two circumstances:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Given a sample of cases that can be classified into several groups, determine if the sample is representative of the general population.
\item Evaluate whether data resemble a particular distribution, such as a normal distribution or a geometric distribution.
\end{itemize}
Each of these scenarios can be addressed using the same statistical test: a chi-square test.

\index{data!racial make-up of jury|(}

In the first case, we consider data from a random sample of 275 jurors in a small county. Jurors identified their racial group, as shown in Table~\ref{juryRepresentationAndCityRepresentationForRace}, and we would like to determine if these jurors are racially representative of the population.  If the jury is representative of the population, then the proportions in the sample should roughly reflect the population of eligible jurors, i.e. registered voters.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll ccc c ll}
\hline
Race	 & \hspace{2mm} & White & Black & Hispanic & Other & \hspace{2mm} & Total \\
\hline
Representation in juries &	& 205 & 26 & 25 & 19 & & 275 \\
Registered voters	 & 		& 0.72 & 0.07 & 0.12 & 0.09 & & 1.00 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Representation by race in a city's juries and population.}
\label{juryRepresentationAndCityRepresentationForRace}
\end{table}

While the proportions in the juries do not precisely represent the population proportions, it is unclear whether these data provide convincing evidence that the sample is not representative. If the jurors really were randomly sampled from the registered voters, we might expect small differences due to chance. However, unusually large differences may provide convincing evidence that the juries were not representative.

A second application, assessing the fit of a distribution, is presented at the end of this section. Daily stock returns from the S\&P500 for the years 1990-2011 are used to assess whether stock activity each day is independent of the stock's behavior on previous days.

In these problems, we would like to examine all bins simultaneously, not simply compare one or two bins at a time, which will require us to develop a new test statistic.


\subsection{Creating a test statistic for one-way tables}

\begin{example}{Of the people in the city, 275 served on a jury. If the individuals are randomly selected to serve on a jury, about how many of the 275 people would we expect to be white? How many would we expect to be black?}
About 72\% of the population is white, so we would expect about 72\% of the jurors to be white: $0.72\times 275 = 198$.

Similarly, we would expect about 7\% of the jurors to be black, which would correspond to about $0.07\times 275 = 19.25$ black jurors.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Twelve percent of the population is Hispanic and 9\% represent other races. How many of the 275 jurors would we expect to be Hispanic or from another race? Answers can be found in Table~\ref{expectedJuryRepresentationIfNoBias}.
\end{exercise}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll ccc c ll}
\hline
Race	 & \hspace{2mm} & White & Black & Hispanic & Other & \hspace{2mm} & Total \\
\hline
Observed data			&	& 205 & 26	& 25 & 19	&	& 275 \\
Expected counts	 &	& 198 & 19.25 & 33 & 24.75 & & 275 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Actual and expected make-up of the jurors.}
\label{expectedJuryRepresentationIfNoBias}
\end{table}

The sample proportion represented from each race among the 275 jurors was not a precise match for any ethnic group. While some sampling variation is expected, we would expect the sample proportions to be fairly similar to the population proportions if there is no bias on juries. We need to test whether the differences are strong enough to provide convincing evidence that the jurors are not a random sample. These ideas can be organized into hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] The jurors are a random sample, i.e. there is no racial bias in who serves on a jury, and the observed counts reflect natural sampling fluctuation.
\item[$H_A$:] The jurors are not randomly sampled, i.e. there is racial bias in juror selection.
\end{itemize}
To evaluate these hypotheses, we quantify how different the observed counts are from the expected counts. Strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis would come in the form of unusually large deviations in the groups from what would be expected based on sampling variation alone.


\subsection{The chi-square test statistic}
\label{chiSquareTestStatistic}

In previous hypothesis tests, we constructed a test statistic of the following form:
$$ \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{\text{SE of point estimate}} $$
This construction was based on (1) identifying the difference between a point estimate and an expected value if the null hypothesis was true, and (2) standardizing that difference using the standard error of the point estimate. These two ideas will help in the construction of an appropriate test statistic for count data.

Our strategy will be to first compute the difference between the observed counts and the counts we would expect if the null hypothesis was true, then we will standardize the difference:
\begin{align*}
Z_{1} = \frac{\text{observed white count} - \text{null white count}}
				{\text{SE of observed white count}}
\end{align*}
The standard error for the point estimate of the count in binned data is the square root of the count under the null.\footnote{Using some of the rules learned in earlier chapters, we might think that the standard error would be $np(1-p)$, where $n$ is the sample size and $p$ is the proportion in the population. This would be correct if we were looking only at one count. However, we are computing many standardized differences and adding them together. It can be shown -- though not here -- that the square root of the count is a better way to standardize the count differences.} Therefore:
\begin{align*}
Z_1 = \frac{205 - 198}{\sqrt{198}} = 0.50
\end{align*}
The fraction is very similar to previous test statistics: first compute a difference, then standardize it. These computations should also be completed for the black, Hispanic, and other groups:
\begin{align*}
&Black && Hispanic	&&Other \\
& Z_2 = \frac{26-19.25}{\sqrt{19.25}}=1.54\ \ \ \ 
	&& Z_3 = \frac{25-33}{\sqrt{33}}=-1.39\ \ \ \ 
	&& Z_4 = \frac{19-24.75}{\sqrt{24.75}}=-1.16 \\
\end{align*}
We would like to use a single test statistic to determine if these four standardized differences are irregularly far from zero. That is, $Z_1$, $Z_2$, $Z_3$, and $Z_4$ must be combined somehow to help determine if they -- as a group -- tend to be unusually far from zero. A first thought might be to take the absolute value of these four standardized differences and add them~up:
\begin{align*}
|Z_1| + |Z_2| + |Z_3| + |Z_4| = 4.58
\end{align*}
Indeed, this does give one number summarizing how far the actual counts are from what was expected. However, it is more common to add the squared values:
\begin{align*}
Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 + Z_3^2 + Z_4^2 = 5.89
\end{align*}
Squaring each standardized difference before adding them together does two things:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Any standardized difference that is squared will now be positive.
\item Differences that already look unusual -- e.g. a standardized difference of 2.5 -- will become much larger after being squared.
\end{itemize}
The test statistic $\chi^2$\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{9mm}

$\chi^2$\vspace{0.5mm}\\\footnotesize chi-square\\test statistic]{\raggedright\vspace{9mm}

$\chi^2$\vspace{0.5mm}\\\footnotesize chi-square\\test statistic},\index{chi-square statistic} which is the sum of the $Z^2$ values, is generally used for these reasons. We can also write an equation for $\chi^2$ using the observed counts and null counts:
\index{data!racial make-up of jury|)}
{\begin{align*}
\chi^2 &=
	\frac
	{\text{\footnotesize$(\text{observed count}_1 - \text{null count}_1)^2$}}
	{\text{\footnotesize$\text{null count}_1$}}
	+ \dots + \frac
	{\text{\footnotesize$(\text{observed count}_4 - \text{null count}_4)^2$}}
	{\text{\footnotesize$\text{null count}_4$}}
\end{align*}
}The final number $\chi^2$ summarizes how strongly the observed counts tend to deviate from the null counts. In Section~\ref{pValueForAChiSquareTest}, we will see that if the null hypothesis is true, then $\chi^2$ follows a new distribution called a \emph{chi-square distribution}. Using this distribution, we will be able to obtain a p-value to evaluate the hypotheses.


\subsection{The chi-square distribution and finding areas}

The \term{chi-square distribution} is sometimes used to characterize data sets and statistics that are always positive and typically right skewed. Recall the normal distribution had two parameters -- mean and standard deviation -- that could be used to describe its exact characteristics. The chi-square distribution has just one parameter called \termsub{degrees of freedom (df)}{degrees of freedom (df)!chi-square}, which influences the shape, center, and spread of the distribution.

\begin{exercise}\label{exerChiSquareDistributionDescriptionWithMoreDOF}
Figure~\ref{chiSquareDistributionWithInceasingDF} shows three chi-square distributions. (a) How does the center of the distribution change when the degrees of freedom is larger? (b) What about the variability (spread)? (c) How does the shape change?\footnote{(a)~The center becomes larger. If we look carefully, we can see that the center of each distribution is equal to the distribution's degrees of freedom. (b)~The variability increases as the degrees of freedom increases. (c)~The distribution is very strongly skewed for $df=2$, and then the distributions become more symmetric for the larger degrees of freedom $df=4$ and $df=9$. We would see this trend continue if we examined distributions with even more larger degrees of freedom.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_props/figures/chiSquareDistributionWithInceasingDF/chiSquareDistributionWithInceasingDF}
\caption{Three chi-square distributions with varying degrees of freedom.}
\label{chiSquareDistributionWithInceasingDF}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{chiSquareDistributionWithInceasingDF} and Guided Practice~\ref{exerChiSquareDistributionDescriptionWithMoreDOF} demonstrate three general properties of chi-square distributions as the degrees of freedom increases: the distribution becomes more symmetric, the center moves to the right, and the variability inflates.

Our principal interest in the chi-square distribution is the calculation of p-values, which (as we have seen before) is related to finding the relevant area in the tail of a distribution. To do so, a new table is needed: the \term{chi-square table}, partially shown in Table~\ref{chiSquareProbabilityTableShort}. A more complete table is presented in Appendix~\vref{chiSquareProbabilityTable}. This table is very similar to the $t$-table: we examine a particular row for distributions with different degrees of freedom, and we identify a range for the area. One important difference from the $t$-table is that the chi-square table only provides upper tail values.

This distribution has three degrees of freedom, so only the row with 3 degrees of freedom (df) is relevant. This row has been italicized in the table.

\subsection{Finding a p-value for a chi-square distribution}
\label{pValueForAChiSquareTest}

\index{data!racial make-up of jury|(}
In Section~\ref{chiSquareTestStatistic}, we identified a new test statistic ($\chi^2$) within the context of assessing whether there was evidence of racial bias in how jurors were sampled. The null hypothesis represented the claim that jurors were randomly sampled and there was no racial bias. The alternative hypothesis was that there was racial bias in how the jurors were sampled.

We determined that a large $\chi^2$ value would suggest strong evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis: that there was racial bias. However, we could not quantify what the chance was of observing such a large test statistic ($\chi^2=5.89$) if the null hypothesis actually was true. This is where the chi-square distribution becomes useful. If the null hypothesis was true and there was no racial bias, then $\chi^2$ would follow a chi-square distribution, with three degrees of freedom in this case. Under certain conditions, the statistic $\chi^2$ follows a chi-square distribution with $k - 1$ degrees of freedom, where $k$ is the number of bins.

\begin{example}{How many categories were there in the juror example? How many degrees of freedom should be associated with the chi-square distribution used for $\chi^2$?}
In the jurors example, there were $k=4$ categories: white, black, Hispanic, and other. According to the rule above, the test statistic $\chi^2$ should then follow a chi-square distribution with $k-1 = 3$ degrees of freedom if $H_0$ is true.
\end{example}

Just like we checked sample size conditions to use the normal model in earlier sections, we must also check a sample size condition to safely apply the chi-square distribution for $\chi^2$. Each expected count must be at least 5. In the juror example, the expected counts were 198, 19.25, 33, and 24.75, all easily above~5, so we can apply the chi-square model to the test statistic, $\chi^2=5.89$.

\begin{example}{If the null hypothesis is true, the test statistic $\chi^2=5.89$ would be closely associated with a chi-square distribution with three degrees of freedom. Using this distribution and test statistic, identify the p-value.}
The chi-square distribution and p-value are shown in Figure~\ref{jurorHTPValueShown}. Because larger chi-square values correspond to stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, we shade the upper tail to represent the p-value. Using the chi-square table in Appendix~\ref{chiSquareProbabilityTable} or the short table on page~\pageref{chiSquareProbabilityTableShort}, we can determine that the area is between 0.1 and 0.2. That is, the p-value is larger than 0.1 but smaller than 0.2. Generally we do not reject the null hypothesis with such a large p-value. In other words, the data do not provide convincing evidence of racial bias in the juror selection.
\index{data!racial make-up of jury|)}

\label{jurorHTPValueShown}
\end{figure}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Chi-square test for one-way table}
Suppose we are to evaluate whether there is convincing evidence that a set of observed counts $O_1$, $O_2$, ..., $O_k$ in $k$ categories are unusually different from what might be expected under a null hypothesis. Call the \emph{expected counts} that are based on the null hypothesis $E_1$, $E_2$, ..., $E_k$. If each expected count is at least 5 and the null hypothesis is true, then the test statistic below follows a chi-square distribution with $k-1$ degrees of freedom:
\begin{align*}
\chi^2 = \frac{(O_1 - E_1)^2}{E_1} + \frac{(O_2 - E_2)^2}{E_2} + \cdots + \frac{(O_k - E_k)^2}{E_k}
\end{align*}
The p-value for this test statistic is found by looking at the upper tail of this chi-square distribution. We consider the upper tail because larger values of $\chi^2$ would provide greater evidence against the null hypothesis.}
\end{termBox}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Conditions for the chi-square test}
There are two conditions that must be checked before performing a chi-square test:\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{description}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[Independence.] Each case that contributes a count to the table must be independent of all the other cases in the table.
\item[Sample size / distribution.] Each particular scenario (i.e. cell count) must have at least 5~expected cases.
\vspace{-1mm}
\end{description}
Failing to check conditions may affect the test's error rates.}
\end{tipBox}

When examining a table with just two bins, pick a single bin and use the one-proportion methods introduced in Section~\ref{singleProportion}.


\subsection{Evaluating goodness of fit for a distribution}

Section~\ref{geomDist} would be useful background reading for this example, but it is not a prerequisite.

\index{data!S\&P500 stock data|(}

We can apply our new chi-square testing framework to the second problem in this section: evaluating whether a certain statistical model fits a data set. Daily stock returns from the S\&P500 for 1990-2011 can be used to assess whether stock activity each day is independent of the stock's behavior on previous days. This sounds like a very complex question, and it is, but a chi-square test can be used to study the problem. We will label each day as \resp{Up} or \resp{Down} (\resp{D}) depending on whether the market was up or down that day. For example, consider the following changes in price, their new labels of up and down, and then the number of days that must be observed before each \resp{Up} day:
\begin{center}\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{lc ccc ccc ccc cc}
Change in price		&\hspace{-1mm}	& \footnotesize2.52 &
	\footnotesize-1.46 & \footnotesize 0.51 &
	\footnotesize-4.07 & \footnotesize3.36 &
	\footnotesize1.10 &
	\footnotesize-5.46 & \footnotesize-1.03 & \footnotesize-2.99 & \footnotesize1.71 \\
Outcome	 & \hspace{-1mm} &
	Up &
	D & Up &
	D & Up &
	Up &
	D & D & D & Up \\
\footnotesize Days to Up & \hspace{-1mm} & 1 & - & 2 & - & 2 & 1 & - & - & - & 4 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
If the days really are independent, then the number of days until a positive trading day should follow a geometric distribution. The geometric distribution describes the probability of waiting for the $k^{th}$ trial to observe the first success. Here each up day (Up) represents a success, and down (D) days represent failures. In the data above, it took only one day until the market was up, so the first wait time was 1 day. It took two more days before we observed our next \resp{Up} trading day, and two more for the third \resp{Up} day. We would like to determine if these counts (1, 2, 2, 1, 4, and so on) follow the geometric distribution. Table~\ref{sAndP500For1990To2011TimeToPosTrade} shows the number of waiting days for a positive trading day during 1990-2011 for the S\&P500.

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{ll ccc ccc c ll}
\hline
Days	 & \hspace{2mm} & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7+ & \hspace{2mm} & Total \\

\caption{Observed distribution of the waiting time until a positive trading day for the S\&P500, 1990-2011.}
\label{sAndP500For1990To2011TimeToPosTrade}
\end{table}

We consider how many days one must wait until observing an \resp{Up} day on the S\&P500 stock index. If the stock activity was independent from one day to the next and the probability of a positive trading day was constant, then we would expect this waiting time to follow a \emph{geometric distribution}. We can organize this into a hypothesis framework:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$H_0$:] The stock market being up or down on a given day is independent from all other days. We will consider the number of days that pass until an \resp{Up} day is observed. Under this hypothesis, the number of days until an \resp{Up} day should follow a geometric distribution.
\item[$H_A$:] The stock market being up or down on a given day is not independent from all other days. Since we know the number of days until an \resp{Up} day would follow a geometric distribution under the null, we look for deviations from the geometric distribution, which would support the alternative hypothesis.
\end{itemize}
There are important implications in our result for stock traders: if information from past trading days is useful in telling what will happen today, that information may provide an advantage over other traders.

We consider data for the S\&P500 from 1990 to 2011 and summarize the waiting times in Table~\ref{sAndP500For1990To2011TimeToPosTrade2} and Figure~\ref{geomFitEvaluationForSP500For1990To2011}. The S\&P500 was positive on 53.2\% of those days.

To find each expected count, we identify the probability of waiting $D$ days based on the geometric model ($P(D) = (1-0.532)^{D-1}(0.532)$) and multiply by the total number of streaks, 2948. For example, waiting for three days occurs under the geometric model about $0.468^2\times 0.532 = 11.65\%$ of the time, which corresponds to $0.1165\times 2948 = 343$ streaks.}

\caption{Side-by-side bar plot of the observed and expected counts for each waiting time.}
\label{geomFitEvaluationForSP500For1990To2011}
\end{figure}

Because applying the chi-square framework requires expected counts to be at least~5, we have \emph{binned} together all the cases where the waiting time was at least 7 days to ensure each expected count is well above this minimum. The actual data, shown in the \emph{Observed} row in Table~\ref{sAndP500For1990To2011TimeToPosTrade2}, can be compared to the expected counts from the \emph{Geometric Model} row. The method for computing expected counts is discussed in Table~\ref{sAndP500For1990To2011TimeToPosTrade2}. In general, the expected counts are determined by (1) identifying the null proportion associated with each bin, then (2) multiplying each null proportion by the total count to obtain the expected counts. That is, this strategy identifies what proportion of the total count we would expect to be in each bin.

\begin{example}{Do you notice any unusually large deviations in the graph? Can you tell if these deviations are due to chance just by looking?}
It is not obvious whether differences in the observed counts and the expected counts from the geometric distribution are significantly different. That is, it is not clear whether these deviations might be due to chance or whether they are so strong that the data provide convincing evidence against the null hypothesis. However, we can perform a chi-square test using the counts in Table~\ref{sAndP500For1990To2011TimeToPosTrade2}.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Table~\ref{sAndP500For1990To2011TimeToPosTrade2} provides a set of count data for waiting times ($O_1=1532$, $O_2=760$, ...) and expected counts under the geometric distribution ($E_1=1569$, $E_2=734$, ...). Compute the chi-square test statistic, $\chi^2$.\footnote{$\chi^2=\frac{(1532-1569)^2}{1569} + \frac{(760-734)^2}{734} + \cdots + \frac{(17-31)^2}{31} = 15.08$}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Because the expected counts are all at least~5, we can safely apply the chi-square distribution to $\chi^2$. However, how many degrees of freedom should we~use?\footnote{There are $k=7$ groups, so we use $df=k-1=6$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{If the observed counts follow the geometric model, then the chi-square test statistic $\chi^2=15.08$ would closely follow a chi-square distribution with $df=6$. Using this information, compute a p-value.} \label{RejectGeomModelForSP500StockDataFor1990To2011}
Figure~\ref{geomFitPValueForSP500For1990To2011} shows the chi-square distribution, cutoff, and the shaded p-value. If we look up the statistic $\chi^2=15.08$ in Appendix~\ref{chiSquareProbabilityTable}, we find that the p-value is between 0.01 and 0.02. In other words, we have sufficient evidence to reject the notion that the wait times follow a geometric distribution, i.e. trading days are not independent and past days may help predict what the stock market will do today.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{In Example~\ref{RejectGeomModelForSP500StockDataFor1990To2011}, we rejected the null hypothesis that the trading days are independent. Why is this so important?}
Because the data provided strong evidence that the geometric distribution is not appropriate, we reject the claim that trading days are independent. While it is not obvious how to exploit this information, it suggests there are some hidden patterns in the data that could be interesting and possibly useful to a stock trader.

\label{twoWayTablesAndChiSquare}

\index{data!search algorithm|(}

Google is constantly running experiments to test new search algorithms. For example, Google might test three algorithms using a sample of 10,000 google.com search queries. Table~\ref{googleSearchAlgorithmByAlgorithmOnly} shows an example of 10,000 queries split into three algorithm groups.\footnote{Google regularly runs experiments in this manner to help improve their search engine. It is entirely possible that if you perform a search and so does your friend, that you will have different search results. While the data presented in this section resemble what might be encountered in a real experiment, these data are simulated.} The group sizes were specified before the start of the experiment to be 5000 for the current algorithm and 2500 for each test algorithm.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll ccc ll}
\hline
Search algorithm	 & \hspace{1mm} & current & test 1 & test 2 & \hspace{1mm} & Total \\
Counts &		& 5000 & 2500 & 2500 & & 10000 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Google experiment breakdown of test subjects into three search groups.}
\label{googleSearchAlgorithmByAlgorithmOnly}
\end{table}

\begin{example}{What is the ultimate goal of the Google experiment? What are the null and alternative hypotheses, in regular words?}
The ultimate goal is to see whether there is a difference in the performance of the algorithms. The hypotheses can be described as the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$H_0$:] The algorithms each perform equally well.
\item[$H_A$:] The algorithms do not perform equally well.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

In this experiment, the explanatory variable is the search algorithm. However, an outcome variable is also needed. This outcome variable should somehow reflect whether the search results align with the user's interests. One possible way to quantify this is to determine whether (1)~the user clicked one of the links provided and did not try a new search, or (2)~the user performed a related search. Under scenario~(1), we might think that the user was satisfied with the search results. Under scenario~(2), the search results probably were not relevant, so the user tried a second search.

Table~\ref{googleSearchAlgorithmByAlgorithmAndPerformanceWithTotals} provides the results from the experiment. These data are very similar to the count data in Section~\ref{oneWayChiSquare}. However, now the different combinations of two variables are binned in a \emph{two-way} table. In examining these data, we want to evaluate whether there is strong evidence that at least one algorithm is performing better than the others. To do so, we apply a chi-square test to this two-way table. The ideas of this test are similar to those ideas in the one-way table case. However, degrees of freedom and expected counts are computed a little differently than before.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll ccc ll}
\hline
Search algorithm & \hspace{1mm} & current & test 1 & test 2 & \hspace{1mm} & Total \\
\hline
No new search				   & & 3511    & 1749 & 1818 & 				& 7078 \\
New search				   & & 1489    & 751	& 682    &				& 2922 \\
\hline
Total						   & & 5000    & 2500 & 2500 & 				& 10000 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Results of the Google search algorithm experiment.}
\label{googleSearchAlgorithmByAlgorithmAndPerformanceWithTotals}
\end{table}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle[]{What is so different about one-way tables and two-way tables?}
A one-way table describes counts for each outcome in a single variable. A two-way table describes counts for \emph{combinations} of outcomes for two variables. When we consider a two-way table, we often would like to know, are these variables related in any way? That is, are they dependent (versus independent)?}
\end{tipBox}

The hypothesis test for this Google experiment is really about assessing whether there is statistically significant evidence that the choice of the algorithm affects whether a user performs a second search. In other words, the goal is to check whether the \var{search} variable is independent of the \var{algorithm} variable.


\subsection{Expected counts in two-way tables}

\begin{example}{From the experiment, we estimate the proportion of users who were satisfied with their initial search (no new search) as $7078/10000 = 0.7078$. If there really is no difference among the algorithms and 70.78\% of people are satisfied with the search results, how many of the 5000 people in the ``current algorithm'' group would be expected to not perform a new search?} \label{googleExampleComputingTheExpectedNumberOfCurrentGroupWithNoNewSearch}
About 70.78\% of the 5000 would be satisfied with the initial search:
$$ 0.7078\times 5000 = 3539\text{ users} $$
That is, if there was no difference between the three groups, then we would expect 3539 of the current algorithm users not to perform a new search.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}\label{googleExampleComputingTheExpectedNumberOfNewAlgGroupWithNoNewSearch}
Using the same rationale described in Example~\ref{googleExampleComputingTheExpectedNumberOfCurrentGroupWithNoNewSearch}, about how many users in each test group would not perform a new search if the algorithms were equally helpful?\footnote{We would expect $0.7078*2500 = 1769.5$. It is okay that this is a fraction.}
\end{exercise}

We can compute the expected number of users who would perform a new search for each group using the same strategy employed in Example~\ref{googleExampleComputingTheExpectedNumberOfCurrentGroupWithNoNewSearch} and Guided Practice~\ref{googleExampleComputingTheExpectedNumberOfNewAlgGroupWithNoNewSearch}. These expected counts were used to construct Table~\ref{googleSearchAlgorithmByAlgorithmAndPerformanceWithExpectedCounts}, which is the same as Table~\ref{googleSearchAlgorithmByAlgorithmAndPerformanceWithTotals}, except now the expected counts have been added in parentheses.

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{l lll lll lll l}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{The observed counts and the \highlightO{(expected counts)}.}
\label{googleSearchAlgorithmByAlgorithmAndPerformanceWithExpectedCounts}
\end{table}

The examples and exercises above provided some help in computing expected counts. In general, expected counts for a two-way table may be computed using the row totals, column totals, and the table total. For instance, if there was no difference between the groups, then about 70.78\% of each column should be in the first row:
\begin{align*}
0.7078\times (\text{column 1 total}) &= 3539 \\
0.7078\times (\text{column 2 total}) &= 1769.5 \\
0.7078\times (\text{column 3 total}) &= 1769.5
\end{align*}
Looking back to how the fraction 0.7078 was computed -- as the fraction of users who did not perform a new search ($7078/10000$) -- these three expected counts could have been computed as
\begin{align*}
\left(\frac{\text{row 1 total}}{\text{table total}}\right)\text{(column 1 total)} &= 3539 \\
\left(\frac{\text{row 1 total}}{\text{table total}}\right)\text{(column 2 total)} &= 1769.5 \\
\left(\frac{\text{row 1 total}}{\text{table total}}\right)\text{(column 3 total)} &= 1769.5
\end{align*}
This leads us to a general formula for computing expected counts in a two-way table when we would like to test whether there is strong evidence of an association between the column variable and row variable.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Computing expected counts in a two-way table}
To identify the expected count for the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column, compute
$$\text{Expected Count}_{\text{row }i,\text{ col }j} = \frac{(\text{row $i$ total}) \times  (\text{column $j$ total})}{\text{table total}}\vspace{2mm}$$}
\end{termBox}


\textC{\newpage}


\subsection{The chi-square test for two-way tables}

The chi-square test statistic for a two-way table is found the same way it is found for a one-way table. For each table count, compute
\begin{align*}
&\text{General formula}& &\frac{(\text{observed count } - \text{ expected count})^2}{\text{expected count}} \\
&\text{Row 1, Col 1}& &\frac{(3511 - 3539)^2}{3539} = 0.222 \\
&\text{Row 1, Col 2}& &\frac{(1749 - 1769.5)^2}{1769.5} = 0.237 \\
& \hspace{9mm}\vdots & &\hspace{13mm}\vdots \\
&\text{Row 2, Col 3}& &\frac{(682 - 730.5)^2}{730.5} = 3.220
\end{align*}
Adding the computed value for each cell gives the chi-square test statistic $\chi^2$:
$$\chi^2 = 0.222 + 0.237 + \dots + 3.220 = 6.120$$
Just like before, this test statistic follows a chi-square distribution. However, the degrees of freedom are computed a little differently for a two-way table.\footnote{Recall: in the one-way table, the degrees of freedom was the number of cells minus 1.} For two way tables, the degrees of freedom is equal to
\begin{align*}
df = \text{(number of rows minus 1)}\times \text{(number of columns minus 1)}
\end{align*}
In our example, the degrees of freedom parameter is
\begin{align*}
df = (2-1)\times (3-1) = 2
\end{align*}
If the null hypothesis is true (i.e. the algorithms are equally useful), then the test statistic $\chi^2 = 6.12$ closely follows a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. Using this information, we can compute the p-value for the test, which is depicted in Figure~\ref{googleHTForDiffAlgPerformancePValue}.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Computing degrees of freedom for a two-way table}
When applying the chi-square test to a two-way table, we use
$$ df = (R-1)\times (C-1) $$
where $R$ is the number of rows in the table and $C$ is the number of columns.}
\end{termBox}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Use two-proportion methods for 2-by-2 contingency tables}
When analyzing 2-by-2 contingency tables, use the two-proportion methods introduced in Section~\ref{differenceOfTwoProportions}.}

\begin{example}{Compute the p-value and draw a conclusion about whether the search algorithms have different performances.}
Looking in Appendix~\ref{chiSquareProbabilityTable} on page~\pageref{chiSquareProbabilityTable}, we examine the row corresponding to 2 degrees of freedom. The test statistic, $\chi^2=6.120$, falls between the fourth and fifth columns, which means the p-value is between 0.02 and 0.05. Because we typically test at a significance level of $\alpha=0.05$ and the p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected. That is, the data provide convincing evidence that there is some difference in performance among the algorithms.

Similarly for the first column and the second row: $\frac{2104\times 1458}{4223} = 726.4$. Column 2: 693.5 and 688.5. Column 3: 694.0 and 689.0.}

Compute the chi-square test statistic.\footnote{For each cell, compute $\frac{(\text{obs} - \text{exp})^2}{exp}$. For instance, the first row and first column: $\frac{(842-731.6)^2}{731.6} = 16.7$.

\section[Small sample hypothesis testing for a proportion (special topic)]{Small sample hypothesis testing for a proportion\\(special topic)}
\label{smallSampleHTForProportion}

In this section we develop inferential methods for a single proportion that are appropriate when the sample size is too small to apply the normal model to $\hat{p}$. Just like the methods related to the $t$-distribution, these methods can also be applied to large samples.

\subsection{When the success-failure condition is not met}

\index{data!medical consultant|(}
People providing an organ for donation sometimes seek the help of a special ``medical consultant''. These consultants assist the patient in all aspects of the surgery, with the goal of reducing the possibility of complications during the medical procedure and recovery. Patients might choose a consultant based in part on the historical complication rate of the consultant's clients. One consultant tried to attract patients by noting the average complication rate for liver donor surgeries in the US is about 10\%, but her clients have only had 3 complications in the 62 liver donor surgeries she has facilitated. She claims this is strong evidence that her work meaningfully contributes to reducing complications (and therefore she should be hired!).

\begin{exercise}
We will let $p$ represent the true complication rate for liver donors working with this consultant. Estimate $p$ using the data, and label this value~$\hat{p}$.\footnote{The sample proportion: $\hat{p} = 3/62 = 0.048$}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{Is it possible to assess the consultant's claim with the data provided?}
No. The claim is that there is a causal connection, but the data are observational. Patients who hire this medical consultant may have lower complication rates for other reasons.

While it is not possible to assess this causal claim, it is still possible to test for an association using these data. For this question we ask, could the low complication rate of $\hat{p} = 0.048$ be due to chance?
\end{example}

\begin{exercise} \label{hypForAssessingConsultantWorkInLiverTransplants}
Write out hypotheses in both plain and statistical language to test for the association between the consultant's work and the true complication rate, $p$, for this consultant's clients.\footnote{$H_0$: There is no association between the consultant's contributions and the clients' complication rate. In statistical language, $p=0.10$. $H_A$: Patients who work with the consultant tend to have a complication rate lower than 10\%, i.e. $p<0.10$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{In the examples based on large sample theory, we modeled $\hat{p}$ using the normal distribution. Why is this not appropriate here?}
The independence assumption may be reasonable if each of the surgeries is from a different surgical team. However, the success-failure condition is not satisfied. Under the null hypothesis, we would anticipate seeing $62\times 0.10=6.2$ complications, not the 10 required for the normal approximation.
\end{example}

The uncertainty associated with the sample proportion should not be modeled using the normal distribution. However, we would still like to assess the hypotheses from Guided Practice~\ref{hypForAssessingConsultantWorkInLiverTransplants} in absence of the normal framework. To do so, we need to evaluate the possibility of a sample value ($\hat{p}$) this far below the null value, $p_0=0.10$. This possibility is usually measured with a p-value.

The p-value is computed based on the null distribution, which is the distribution of the test statistic if the null hypothesis is true. Supposing the null hypothesis is true, we can compute the p-value by identifying the chance of observing a test statistic that favors the alternative hypothesis at least as strongly as the observed test statistic. This can be done using simulation.


\subsection{Generating the null distribution and p-value by simulation}
\label{generatingTheNullDistributionAndPValueBySimulationForOneProportion}

We want to identify the sampling distribution of the test statistic ($\hat{p}$) if the null hypothesis was true. In other words, we want to see how the sample proportion changes due to chance alone. Then we plan to use this information to decide whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Under the null hypothesis, 10\% of liver donors have complications during or after surgery. Suppose this rate was really no different for the consultant's clients. If this was the case, we could \emph{simulate} 62 clients to get a sample proportion for the complication rate from the null distribution.

Each client can be simulated using a deck of cards. Take one red card, nine black cards, and mix them up. Then drawing a card is one way of simulating the chance a patient has a complication \emph{if the true complication rate is 10\%} for the data. If we do this 62 times and compute the proportion of patients with complications in the simulation, $\hat{p}_{sim}$, then this sample proportion is exactly a sample from the null distribution.

An undergraduate student was paid \$2 to complete this simulation. There were 5 simulated cases with a complication and 57 simulated cases without a complication, i.e. $\hat{p}_{sim} = 5/62 = 0.081$.

\begin{example}{Is this one simulation enough to determine whether or not we should reject the null hypothesis from Guided Practice~\ref{hypForAssessingConsultantWorkInLiverTransplants}? Explain.}
No. To assess the hypotheses, we need to see a distribution of many $\hat{p}_{sim}$, not just a \emph{single} draw from this sampling distribution.
\end{example}

One simulation isn't enough to get a sense of the null distribution; many simulation studies are needed. Roughly 10,000 seems sufficient. However, paying someone to simulate 10,000 studies by hand is a waste of time and money. Instead, simulations are typically programmed into a computer, which is much more efficient.

Figure~\ref{nullDistForPHatIfLiverTransplantConsultantIsNotHelpful} shows the results of 10,000 simulated studies. The proportions that are equal to or less than $\hat{p}=0.048$ are shaded. The shaded areas represent sample proportions under the null distribution that provide at least as much evidence as $\hat{p}$ favoring the alternative hypothesis. There were 1222 simulated sample proportions with $\hat{p}_{sim} \leq 0.048$. We use these to construct the null distribution's left-tail area and find the p-value:
\begin{align}
\text{left tail }\label{estOfPValueBasedOnSimulatedNullForSingleProportion}
	&= \frac{\text{Number of observed simulations with }\hat{p}_{sim}\leq\text{ 0.048}}{10000}
\end{align}
Of the 10,000 simulated $\hat{p}_{sim}$, 1222 were equal to or smaller than $\hat{p}$. Since the hypothesis test is one-sided, the estimated p-value is equal to this tail area: 0.1222.

Does the conclusion in Guided Practice~\ref{plainLanguageExplanationOfHTConclusionForLiverDonorSurgicalConsultant} imply there is no real association between the surgical consultant's work and the risk of complications? Explain.\footnote{No. It might be that the consultant's work is associated with a reduction but that there isn't enough data to convincingly show this connection.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{One-sided hypothesis test for $p$ with a small sample}
The p-value is always derived by analyzing the null distribution of the test statistic. The normal model poorly approximates the null distribution for $\hat{p}$ when the success-failure condition is not satisfied. As a substitute, we can generate the null distribution using simulated sample proportions ($\hat{p}_{sim}$) and use this distribution to compute the tail area, i.e. the p-value.}
\end{termBox}

We continue to use the same rule as before when computing the p-value for a two-sided test: double the single tail area, which remains a reasonable approach even when the sampling distribution is asymmetric. However, this can result in p-values larger than 1 when the point estimate is very near the mean in the null distribution; in such cases, we write that the p-value is 1. Also, very large p-values computed in this way (e.g. 0.85), may also be slightly inflated.

Guided Practice~\ref{plainLanguageExplanationOfHTConclusionForLiverDonorSurgicalConsultant} said the p-value is \emph{estimated}. It is not exact because the simulated null distribution itself is not exact, only a close approximation. However, we can generate an exact null distribution and p-value using the binomial model from Section~\ref{binomialModel}.

\subsection{Generating the exact null distribution and p-value}
\label{exactNullDistributionUsingBinomialModel}

The number of successes in $n$ independent cases can be described using the binomial model, which was introduced in Section~\ref{binomialModel}. Recall that the probability of observing exactly $k$ successes is given by
\begin{align} \label{binomialEquationShownForFindingNullDistributionInSmallSamplePropTest}
P(k\text{ successes}) = {n\choose k} p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}
\end{align}
where $p$ is the true probability of success. The expression ${n\choose k}$ is read as \emph{$n$ choose $k$}, and the exclamation points represent factorials. For instance, $3!$ is equal to $3\times 2\times 1=6$, $4!$ is equal to $4\times 3\times 2\times 1 = 24$, and so on (see Section~\ref{binomialModel}).

The tail area of the null distribution is computed by adding up the probability in Equation~\eqref{binomialEquationShownForFindingNullDistributionInSmallSamplePropTest} for each $k$ that provides at least as strong of evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis as the data. If the hypothesis test is one-sided, then the p-value is represented by a single tail area. If the test is two-sided, compute the single tail area and double it to get the p-value, just as we have done in the past.

\textC{\pagebreak}

\begin{example}{Compute the exact p-value to check the consultant's claim that her clients' complication rate is below 10\%.}
Exactly $k=3$ complications were observed in the $n=62$ cases cited by the consultant. Since we are testing against the 10\% national average, our null hypothesis is $p=0.10$. We can compute the p-value by adding up the cases where there are 3 or fewer complications:
\begin{align*}
\text{p-value}
	&= \sum_{j=0}^{3} {n\choose j} p^{j}(1-p)^{n-j} \\
	&= \sum_{j=0}^{3} {62\choose j} 0.1^{j}(1-0.1)^{62-j} \\
	&= {62\choose 0} 0.1^{0}(1-0.1)^{62-0} +
		{62\choose 1} 0.1^{1}(1-0.1)^{62-1} \\
	& \qquad + {62\choose 2} 0.1^{2}(1-0.1)^{62-2} +
		{62\choose 3} 0.1^{3}(1-0.1)^{62-3} \\
	&= 0.0015 + 0.0100 + 0.0340 + 0.0755 \\
	&= 0.1210
\end{align*}
This exact p-value is very close to the p-value based on the simulations (0.1222), and we come to the same conclusion. We do not reject the null hypothesis, and there is not statistically significant evidence to support the association.

If it were plotted, the exact null distribution would look almost identical to the simulated null distribution shown in Figure~\ref{nullDistForPHatIfLiverTransplantConsultantIsNotHelpful} on page~\pageref{nullDistForPHatIfLiverTransplantConsultantIsNotHelpful}.
\end{example}


\subsection{Using simulation for goodness of fit tests}

Simulation methods may also be used to test goodness of fit. In short, we simulate a new sample based on the purported bin probabilities, then compute a chi-square test statistic $X_{sim}^2$. We do this many times (e.g. 10,000 times), and then examine the distribution of these simulated chi-square test statistics. This distribution will be a very precise null distribution for the test statistic $\chi^2$ if the probabilities are accurate, and we can find the upper tail of this null distribution, using a cutoff of the observed test statistic, to calculate the p-value.

\begin{example}{\index{data!racial make-up of jury|(}Section~\ref{oneWayChiSquare} introduced an example where we considered whether jurors were racially representative of the population. Would our findings differ if we used a simulation technique?}
Since the minimum bin count condition was satisfied, the chi-square distribution is an excellent approximation of the null distribution, meaning the results should be very similar. Figure~\ref{jurorChiSquareSimulated} shows the simulated null distribution using 100,000 simulated $X_{sim}^2$ values with an overlaid curve of the chi-square distribution. The distributions are almost identical, and the p-values are essentially indistinguishable: 0.115 for the simulated null distribution and 0.117 for the theoretical null distribution.

\section{Randomization test (special topic)}
\label{smallSampleHTForTwoOrMoreProportion}

\index{data!CPR and blood thinner|(}

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a procedure commonly used on individuals suffering a heart attack when other emergency resources are not available. This procedure is helpful in maintaining some blood circulation, but the chest compressions involved can also cause internal injuries. Internal bleeding and other injuries complicate additional treatment efforts following arrival at a hospital. For example, blood thinners may be used to release a clot responsible for a heart attack. However, the blood thinner would negatively affect internal bleeding.

We consider an experiment for patients who underwent CPR for a heart attack and were subsequently admitted to a hospital.\footnote{\emph{Efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy after initially unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a prospective clinical trial}, by B$\ddot{\text{o}}$ttiger et al., The Lancet, 2001.} These patients were randomly divided into a treatment group where they received a blood thinner or the control group where they did not receive a blood thinner. The outcome variable of interest was whether the patients survived for at least 24 hours.

\begin{example}{What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this study? Let $p_c$ represent the true survival rate of people who do not receive a blood thinner (corresponding to the control group) and $p_t$ represent the survival rate for people receiving a blood thinner (corresponding to the treatment group).} \label{hypothesesForCPRStudyInSmallSampleSection}
We are interested in whether the blood thinners are helpful or harmful, so a two-sided test is appropriate.
\begin{itemize}
\item[$H_0$:] Blood thinners do not have an overall survival effect, i.e. the survival proportions are the same in each group. $p_t - p_c = 0$.
\item[$H_A$:] Blood thinners do have an impact on survival. $p_t - p_c \neq 0$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\subsection{Large sample framework for a difference in two proportions}

There were 50 patients in the experiment who did not receive the blood thinner and 40 patients who did. The study results are shown in Table~\ref{resultsForCPRStudyInSmallSampleSection}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\hline
			&& Survived 	& Died 	&& Total \\
\hline
Control		&& 11		& 39		&& 50 \\
Treatment		&& 14		& 26		&& 40 \\
\hline
Total			&& 25		& 65		&& 90 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Results for the CPR study. Patients in the treatment group were given a blood thinner, and patients in the control group were not.}
\label{resultsForCPRStudyInSmallSampleSection}
\end{table}

\begin{exercise}
What is the observed survival rate in the control group? And in the treatment group? Also, provide a point estimate of the difference in survival proportions of the two groups: $\hat{p}_t - \hat{p}_c$.\footnote{Observed control survival rate: $p_c = \frac{11}{50} = 0.22$. Treatment survival rate: $p_t = \frac{14}{40} = 0.35$. Observed difference: $\hat{p}_t - \hat{p}_c = 0.35 - 0.22 = 0.13$.}
\end{exercise}

According to the point estimate, for patients who have undergone CPR outside of the hospital, an additional 13\% survive when they are treated with blood thinners. However, this difference might be explainable by chance. We'd like to investigate this using a large sample framework, but we first need to check the conditions for such an approach.

\begin{example}{Can the point estimate of the difference in survival proportions be adequately modeled using a normal distribution?}
We will assume the patients are independent, which is probably reasonable. The success-failure condition is also satisfied. Since the proportions are equal under the null, we can compute the pooled proportion, $\hat{p} = (11+14)/(50+40) = 0.278$, for checking conditions. We find the expected number of successes (13.9, 11.1) and failures (36.1, 28.9) are above 10. The normal model is reasonable.
\end{example}

While we can apply a normal framework as an approximation to find a p-value, we might keep in mind that the expected number of successes is only 13.9 in one group and 11.1 in the other. Below we conduct an analysis relying on the large sample normal theory. We will follow up with a small sample analysis and compare the results.

\begin{example}{Assess the hypotheses presented in Example~\ref{hypothesesForCPRStudyInSmallSampleSection} using a large sample framework. Use a significance level of $\alpha=0.05$.}
We suppose the null distribution of the sample difference follows a normal distribution with mean 0 (the null value) and a standard deviation equal to the standard error of the estimate. The null hypothesis in this case would be that the two proportions are the same, so we compute the standard error using the pooled proportion:
\begin{align*}
SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n_t} + \frac{p(1-p)}{n_c}}
	\approx \sqrt{\frac{0.278(1-0.278)}{40} + \frac{0.278(1-0.278)}{50}} = 0.095
\end{align*}
where we have used the pooled estimate $\left( \hat{p} = \frac{11+14}{50 + 40} = 0.278 \right)$ in place of the true proportion, $p$.

The null distribution with mean zero and standard deviation 0.095 is shown in Figure~\ref{pValueCPRStudyLargeSampleAnalysisInSmallSampleSection}. We compute the tail areas to identify the p-value. To do so, we use the Z-score of the point estimate:
\begin{align*}
Z = \frac{(\hat{p}_t - \hat{p}_c) - \text{null value}}{SE} = \frac{0.13 - 0}{0.095} = 1.37
\end{align*}
If we look this Z-score up in Appendix~\ref{normalProbabilityTable}, we see that the right tail has area 0.0853. The p-value is twice the single tail area: 0.176. This p-value does not provide convincing evidence that the blood thinner helps. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether or not the blood thinner helps or hurts. (Remember, we never ``accept'' the null hypothesis -- we can only reject or fail to reject.)
\end{example}
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.67\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_props/figures/pValueCPRStudyLargeSampleAnalysisInSmallSampleSection/pValueCPRStudyLargeSampleAnalysisInSmallSampleSection}
\caption{The null distribution of the point estimate $\hat{p}_t - \hat{p}_c$ under the large sample framework is a normal distribution with mean $0$ and standard deviation equal to the standard error, in this case $SE=0.095$. The p-value is represented by the shaded areas.}
\label{pValueCPRStudyLargeSampleAnalysisInSmallSampleSection}
\end{figure}

The p-value 0.176 relies on the normal approximation. We know that when the samples sizes are large, this approximation is quite good. However, when the sample sizes are relatively small as in this example, the approximation may only be adequate. Next we develop a simulation technique, apply it to these data, and compare our results. In general, the small sample method we develop may be used for any size sample, small or large, and should be considered as more accurate than the corresponding large sample technique.

\subsection{Simulating a difference under the null distribution}

The ideas in this section were first introduced in the optional Section~\vref{caseStudyGenderDiscrimination}. For the interested reader, this earlier section provides a more in-depth discussion.

Suppose the null hypothesis is true. Then the blood thinner has no impact on survival and the 13\% difference was due to chance. In this case, we can simulate \emph{null} differences that are due to chance using a \emph{randomization technique}.\footnote{The test procedure we employ in this section is formally called a \term{permutation test}.} By randomly assigning ``fake treatment'' and ``fake control'' stickers to the patients' files, we could get a new grouping -- one that is completely due to chance. The expected difference between the two proportions under this simulation is zero.

We run this simulation by taking 40 \resp{treatment\_\hspace{0.3mm}fake} and 50 \resp{control\_\hspace{0.3mm}fake} labels and randomly assigning them to the patients. The label counts of 40 and 50 correspond to the number of treatment and control assignments in the actual study. We use a computer program to randomly assign these labels to the patients, and we organize the simulation results into Table~\ref{resultsForCPRStudyInSmallSampleSectionFake1}.
\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\hline
			&& Survived 	& Died 	&& Total \\
\hline
\resp{control\_\hspace{0.3mm}fake}		&& 15		& 35		&& 50 \\
\resp{treatment\_\hspace{0.3mm}fake}	&& 10		& 30		&& 40 \\
\hline
Total			&& 25		& 65		&& 90 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Simulated results for the CPR study under the null hypothesis. The labels were randomly assigned and are independent of the outcome of the patient.}
\label{resultsForCPRStudyInSmallSampleSectionFake1}
\end{table}

\begin{exercise} \label{exerciseComputingDifferenceForCPRStudyInSmallSampleSectionFake1}
What is the difference in survival rates between the two fake groups in Table~\ref{resultsForCPRStudyInSmallSampleSectionFake1}? How does this compare to the observed 13\% in the real groups?\footnote{The difference is $\hat{p}_{t, fake} - \hat{p}_{c, fake} = \frac{10}{40} - \frac{15}{50} = -0.05$, which is closer to the null value $p_0=0$ than what we observed.}
\end{exercise}

The difference computed in Guided Practice~\ref{exerciseComputingDifferenceForCPRStudyInSmallSampleSectionFake1} represents a draw from the null distribution of the sample differences. Next we generate many more simulated experiments to build up the null distribution, much like we did in Section~\ref{generatingTheNullDistributionAndPValueBySimulationForOneProportion} to build a null distribution for a one sample proportion.

\begin{caution}{Simulation in the two proportion case requires that the null difference is zero}
{The technique described here to simulate a difference from the null distribution relies on an important condition in the null hypothesis: there is no connection between the two variables considered. In some special cases, the null difference might not be zero, and more advanced methods (or a large sample approximation, if appropriate) would be necessary.}
\end{caution}

\subsection{Null distribution for the difference in two proportions}

We build up an approximation to the null distribution by repeatedly creating tables like the one shown in Table~\ref{resultsForCPRStudyInSmallSampleSectionFake1} and computing the sample differences. The null distribution from 10,000 simulations is shown in Figure~\ref{pValueCPRStudySmallSampleAnalysisInSmallSampleSection}.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_inference_for_props/figures/pValueCPRStudySmallSampleAnalysisInSmallSampleSection/pValueCPRStudySmallSampleAnalysisInSmallSampleSection}
\caption{An approximation of the null distribution of the point estimate, $\hat{p}_t - \hat{p}_c$. The p-value is twice the right tail area.}
\label{pValueCPRStudySmallSampleAnalysisInSmallSampleSection}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}{Compare Figures~\ref{pValueCPRStudyLargeSampleAnalysisInSmallSampleSection} and~\ref{pValueCPRStudySmallSampleAnalysisInSmallSampleSection}. How are they similar? How are they different?}
The shapes are similar, but the simulated results show that the continuous approximation of the normal distribution is not very good. We might wonder, how close are the p-values?
\end{example}

\begin{exercise} \label{comparisonOfLargeSampleAndSmallSamplePValueInCPRStudy}
The right tail area is about 0.13. (It is only a coincidence that we also have $\hat{p}_t - \hat{p}_c=0.13$.) The p-value is computed by doubling the right tail area: 0.26. How does this value compare with the large sample approximation for the p-value?\footnote{The approximation in this case is fairly poor (p-values: 0.174 vs. 0.26), though we come to the same conclusion. The data do not provide convincing evidence showing the blood thinner helps or hurts patients.}
\index{data!CPR and blood thinner|)}
\end{exercise}

In general, small sample methods produce more accurate results since they rely on fewer assumptions. However, they often require some extra work or simulations. For this reason, many statisticians use small sample methods only when conditions for large sample methods are not satisfied.


\subsection{Randomization for two-way tables and chi-square}

Randomization methods may also be used for the contingency tables. In short, we create a randomized contingency table, then compute a chi-square test statistic $X_{sim}^2$. We repeat this many times using a computer, and then we examine the distribution of these simulated test statistics. This randomization approach is valid for any sized sample, and it will be more accurate for cases where one or more expected bin counts do not meet the minimum threshold of~5. When the minimum threshold is met, the simulated null distribution will very closely resemble the chi-square distribution. As before, we use the upper tail of the null distribution to calculate the p-value.

\eoce{\qtq{Is yawning contagious\label{yawning_two_sample_randomization}} An experiment 
conducted by the \textit{MythBusters}, a science entertainment TV program on the 
Discovery Channel, tested if a person can be subconsciously influenced into yawning if 
another person near them yawns. 50 people were randomly assigned to two groups: 34 to a 
group where a person near them yawned (treatment) and 16 to a group where there wasn't 
a person yawning near them (control). The following table shows the results of this 
experiment. \footfullcite{data:yawn}

\end{center}
A simulation was conducted to understand the distribution of the test statistic under 
the assumption of independence: having someone yawn near another person has no 
influence on if the other person will yawn. In order to conduct the simulation, a 
researcher wrote yawn on 14 index cards and not yawn on 36 index cards to indicate 
whether or not a person yawned. Then he shuffled the cards and dealt them into two 
groups of size 34 and 16 for treatment and control, respectively. He counted how many 
participants in each simulated group yawned in an apparent response to a nearby yawning 
person, and calculated the difference between the simulated proportions of yawning as 
$\hat{p}_{trtmt,sim} - \hat{p}_{ctrl,sim}$. This simulation was repeated 10,000 times 
using software to obtain 10,000 differences that are due to chance alone. The histogram 
shows the distribution of the simulated differences.

\chapter{Introduction to linear regression}
\label{linRegrForTwoVar}

\index{linear regression|textbf}

Linear regression is a very powerful statistical technique. Many people have some familiarity with regression just from reading the news, where graphs with straight lines are overlaid on scatterplots. Linear models can be used for prediction or to evaluate whether there is a linear relationship between two numerical variables.

Figure~\ref{perfLinearModel} shows two variables whose relationship can be modeled perfectly with a straight line. The equation for the line is
\begin{eqnarray*}
y = 5 + 57.49x
\end{eqnarray*}
Imagine what a perfect linear relationship would mean: you would know the exact value of $y$ just by knowing the value of $x$. This is unrealistic in almost any natural process. For example, if we took family income $x$, this value would provide some useful information about how much financial support $y$ a college may offer a prospective student. However, there would still be variability in financial support, even when comparing students whose families have similar financial backgrounds.

\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/perfLinearModel/perfLinearModel}
   \caption{Requests from twelve separate buyers were simultaneously placed with a trading company to purchase Target Corporation stock (ticker \texttt{TGT}, April 26th, 2012), and the total cost of the shares were reported. Because the cost is computed using a linear formula, the linear fit is perfect.}
   \label{perfLinearModel}
\end{figure}

Linear regression assumes that the relationship between two variables, $x$ and $y$, can be modeled by a straight line:
\begin{eqnarray}
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x
\label{genLinModelWNoErrorTerm}
\end{eqnarray}
\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-10mm}

$\beta_0, \beta_1$\vspace{0.7mm}\\\footnotesize Linear model\\ parameters]{\raggedright\vspace{-10mm}

$\beta_0, \beta_1$\vspace{0.7mm}\\\footnotesize Linear model\\ parameters}where $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ represent two model parameters\index{parameter} ($\beta$ is the Greek letter \emph{beta}\index{Greek!beta@beta ($\beta$)}). These parameters are estimated using data, and we write their point estimates as $b_0$ and $b_1$. When we use $x$ to predict $y$, we usually call $x$ the explanatory or \term{predictor} variable, and we call $y$ the response.

It is rare for all of the data to fall on a straight line, as seen in the three scatterplots in Figure~\ref{imperfLinearModel}. In each case, the data fall around a straight line, even if none of the observations fall exactly on the line. The first plot shows a relatively strong downward linear trend, where the remaining variability in the data around the line is minor relative to the strength of the relationship between $x$ and $y$. The second plot shows an upward trend that, while evident, is not as strong as the first. The last plot shows a very weak downward trend in the data, so slight we can hardly notice it. In each of these examples, we will have some uncertainty regarding our estimates of the model parameters, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. For instance, we might wonder, should we move the line up or down a little, or should we tilt it more or less? As we move forward in this chapter, we will learn different criteria for line-fitting, and we will also learn about the uncertainty associated with estimates of model parameters.

   \label{imperfLinearModel}
\end{figure}

We will also see examples in this chapter where fitting a straight line to the data, even if there is a clear relationship between the variables, is not helpful. One such case is shown in Figure~\ref{notGoodAtAllForALinearModel} where there is a very strong relationship between the variables even though the trend is not linear. We will discuss nonlinear trends in this chapter\MultipleRegressionChapter{ and the next}{}, but the details of fitting nonlinear models are saved for a later course.

\label{lineFittingResidualsCorrelation}

It is helpful to think deeply about the line fitting process. In this section, we examine criteria for identifying a linear model and introduce a new statistic, \emph{correlation}.

\subsection{Beginning with straight lines}

\index{data!possum|(}

Scatterplots were introduced in Chapter~\ref{introductionToData} as a graphical technique to present two numerical variables simultaneously. Such plots permit the relationship between the variables to be examined with ease. Figure~\ref{scattHeadLTotalL} shows a scatterplot for the head length and total length of 104 brushtail possums from Australia. Each point represents a single possum from the data.

\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/scattHeadLTotalL/scattHeadLTotalL}
   \caption{A scatterplot showing head length against total length for 104 brushtail possums. A point representing a possum with head length 94.1mm and total length 89cm is highlighted.}
   \label{scattHeadLTotalL}
\end{figure}

\setlength{\captionwidth}{0.83\mycaptionwidth}
\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/brushtail_possum/brushtail_possum}
   \caption{The common brushtail possum of Australia.\vspace{-1mm} \\

   \label{brushtail_possum}
\end{figure}
\setlength{\captionwidth}{\mycaptionwidth}

The head and total length variables are associated. Possums with an above average total length also tend to have above average head lengths. While the relationship is not perfectly linear, it could be helpful to partially explain the connection between these variables with a straight line.

\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/scattHeadLTotalLTube/scattHeadLTotalLTube}
   \caption{The figure on the left shows head length versus total length, and reveals that many of the points could be captured by a straight band. On the right, we see that a curved band is more appropriate in the scatterplot for \var{weight} and \var{mpgCity} from the \data{cars} data set.}
   \label{scattHeadLTotalLTube}
\end{figure}

Straight lines should only be used when the data appear to have a linear relationship, such as the case shown in the left panel of Figure~\ref{scattHeadLTotalLTube}. The right panel of Figure~\ref{scattHeadLTotalLTube} shows a case where a curved line would be more useful in understanding the relationship between the two variables.

\begin{caution}
{Watch out for curved trends}
{We only consider models based on straight lines in this chapter. If data show a nonlinear trend, like that in the right panel of Figure~\ref{scattHeadLTotalLTube}, more advanced techniques should be used.\vspace{0.7mm}}
\end{caution}

\textC{\newpage}

\subsection{Fitting a line by eye}

We want to describe the relationship between the head length and total length variables in the possum data set using a line. In this example, we will use the total length as the predictor variable, $x$, to predict a possum's head length, $y$. We could fit the linear relationship by eye, as in Figure~\ref{scattHeadLTotalLLine}. The equation for this line is
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{y} = 41 + 0.59x
\label{headLLinModTotalL}
\end{eqnarray}
We can use this line to discuss properties of possums. For instance, the equation predicts a possum with a total length of 80 cm will have a head length of
\begin{align*}
\hat{y} &= 41 + 0.59\times 80 \\
	&= 88.2 % mm
\end{align*}
A ``hat'' on $y$ is used to signify that this is an estimate. This estimate may be viewed as an average: the equation predicts that possums with a total length of 80 cm will have an average head length of 88.2 mm. Absent further information about an 80 cm possum, the prediction for head length that uses the average is a reasonable estimate.

\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.71\textwidth]{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/scattHeadLTotalLLine/scattHeadLTotalLLine}
   \caption{A reasonable linear model was fit to represent the relationship between head length and total length.\textC{\vspace{-2mm}}}
   \label{scattHeadLTotalLLine}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Residuals}

\index{residual|(}

\termsub{Residuals}{residual} are the leftover variation in the data after accounting for the model fit:
\begin{align*}
\text{Data} = \text{Fit} + \text{Residual}
\end{align*}
Each observation will have a residual. If an observation is above the regression line, then its residual, the vertical distance from the observation to the line, is positive. Observations below the line have negative residuals. One goal in picking the right linear model is for these residuals to be as small as possible.

Three observations are noted specially in Figure~\ref{scattHeadLTotalLLine}. The observation marked by an ``$\times$'' has a small, negative residual of about -1; the observation marked by ``$+$'' has a large residual of about +7; and the observation marked by ``$\triangle$'' has a moderate residual of about -4. The size of a residual is usually discussed in terms of its absolute value. For example, the residual for ``$\triangle$'' is larger than that of ``$\times$'' because $|-4|$ is larger than $|-1|$.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Residual: difference between observed and expected}
The residual of the $i^{th}$ observation $(x_i, y_i)$ is the difference of the observed response ($y_i$) and the response we would predict based on the model fit ($\hat{y}_i$):
\begin{eqnarray*}
e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i
\end{eqnarray*}
We typically identify $\hat{y}_i$ by plugging $x_i$ into the model.}
\end{termBox}

\begin{example}{The linear fit shown in Figure~\ref{scattHeadLTotalLLine} is given as $\hat{y} = 41 + 0.59x$. Based on this line, formally compute the residual of the observation $(77.0, 85.3)$. This observation is denoted by ``$\times$'' on the plot. Check it against the earlier visual estimate,~-1.}
We first compute the predicted value of point ``$\times$'' based on the model:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{y}_{\times} = 41+0.59x_{\times} = 41+0.59\times 77.0 = 86.4
\end{eqnarray*}
Next we compute the difference of the actual head length and the predicted head length:
\begin{eqnarray*}
e_{\times} = y_{\times} - \hat{y}_{\times} = 85.3 -  86.4 = -1.1
\end{eqnarray*}
This is very close to the visual estimate of -1.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
If a model underestimates an observation, will the residual be positive or negative? What about if it overestimates the observation?\footnote{If a model underestimates an observation, then the model estimate is below the actual. The residual, which is the actual observation value minus the model estimate, must then be positive. The opposite is true when the model overestimates the observation: the residual is negative.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Compute the residuals for the observations $(85.0, 98.6)$ (``$+$'' in the figure) and $(95.5, 94.0)$ (``$\triangle$'') using the linear relationship $\hat{y} = 41 + 0.59x$. \footnote{($+$) First compute the predicted value based on the model: $$\hat{y}_{+} = 41+0.59x_{+} = 41+0.59\times 85.0 = 91.15$$ Then the residual is given by $$e_{+} = y_{+} - \hat{y}_{+} = 98.6-91.15=7.45$$This was close to the earlier estimate of 7.

($\triangle$) $\hat{y}_{\triangle} = 41+0.59x_{\triangle} = 97.3$. $e_{\triangle} = y_{\triangle} - \hat{y}_{\triangle} = -3.3$, close to the estimate of -4.}
\end{exercise}

Residuals are helpful in evaluating how well a linear model fits a data set. We often display them in a \term{residual plot} such as the one shown in Figure~\ref{scattHeadLTotalLResidualPlot} for the regression line in Figure~\ref{scattHeadLTotalLLine}. The residuals are plotted at their original horizontal locations but with the vertical coordinate as the residual. For instance, the point $(85.0,98.6)_{+}$ had a residual of 7.45, so in the residual plot it is placed at $(85.0, 7.45)$. Creating a residual plot is sort of like tipping the scatterplot over so the regression line is horizontal.

   \includegraphics[width=0.73\textwidth]{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/scattHeadLTotalLResidualPlot/scattHeadLTotalLResidualPlot}
   \caption{Residual plot for the model in Figure~\ref{scattHeadLTotalLLine}.}
   \label{scattHeadLTotalLResidualPlot}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}{One purpose of residual plots is to identify characteristics or patterns still apparent in data after fitting a model. Figure~\ref{sampleLinesAndResPlots} shows three scatterplots with linear models in the first row and residual plots in the second row. Can you identify any patterns remaining in the residuals?}

\begin{figure}

   \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/sampleLinesAndResPlots/sampleLinesAndResPlots}
   \caption{Sample data with their best fitting lines (top row) and their corresponding residual plots (bottom row).}
   \label{sampleLinesAndResPlots}
\end{figure}
In the first data set (first column), the residuals show no obvious patterns. The residuals appear to be scattered randomly around the dashed line that represents 0.

The second data set shows a pattern in the residuals. There is some curvature in the scatterplot, which is more obvious in the residual plot. We should not use a straight line to model these data. Instead, a more advanced technique should be used.

The last plot shows very little upwards trend, and the residuals also show no obvious patterns. It is reasonable to try to fit a linear model to the data. However, it is unclear whether there is statistically significant evidence that the slope parameter is different from zero. The point estimate of the slope parameter, labeled $b_1$, is not zero, but we might wonder if this could just be due to chance. We will address this sort of scenario in Section~\ref{inferenceForLinearRegression}.

\end{example}


\subsection{Describing linear relationships with correlation}

\index{correlation|(}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Correlation: strength of a linear relationship}
\termsub{Correlation}{correlation}, which always takes values between -1 and 1, describes the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. We denote the correlation by $R$.}
\end{termBox}\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{-11.5mm}

$R$\\\footnotesize correlation]{\raggedright\vspace{-11.5mm}

$R$\\\footnotesize correlation}

We can compute the correlation using a formula, just as we did with the sample mean and standard deviation. However, this formula is rather complex,\footnote{Formally, we can compute the correlation for observations $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, ..., $(x_n, y_n)$ using the formula
\begin{eqnarray*}
R = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{x_i-\bar{x}}{s_x}\frac{y_i-\bar{y}}{s_y}
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\bar{x}$, $\bar{y}$, $s_x$, and $s_y$ are the sample means and standard deviations for each variable.} so we generally perform the calculations on a computer or calculator. Figure~\ref{posNegCorPlots} shows eight plots and their corresponding correlations. Only when the relationship is perfectly linear is the correlation either -1 or 1. If the relationship is strong and positive, the correlation will be near +1. If it is strong and negative, it will be near -1. If there is no apparent linear relationship between the variables, then the correlation will be near zero.

\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/posNegCorPlots/posNegCorPlots}
   \caption{Sample scatterplots and their correlations. The first row shows variables with a positive relationship, represented by the trend up and to the right. The second row shows variables with a negative trend, where a large value in one variable is associated with a low value in the other.}
   \label{posNegCorPlots}
\end{figure}

The correlation is intended to quantify the strength of a linear trend. Nonlinear trends, even when strong, sometimes produce correlations that do not reflect the strength of the relationship; see three such examples in Figure~\ref{corForNonLinearPlots}.

\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.96\textwidth]{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/posNegCorPlots/corForNonLinearPlots}
   \caption{Sample scatterplots and their correlations. In each case, there is a strong relationship between the variables. However, the correlation is not very strong, and the relationship is not linear.}
   \label{corForNonLinearPlots}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
It appears no straight line would fit any of the datasets represented in Figure~\ref{corForNonLinearPlots}. Try drawing nonlinear curves on each plot. Once you create a curve for each, describe what is important in your fit.\footnote{We'll leave it to you to draw the lines. In general, the lines you draw should be close to most points and reflect overall trends in the data.}

\section[Fitting a line by least squares regression]{Fitting a line by least squares regression \sectionvideohref{youtube-z8DmwG2G4Qc&list=PLkIselvEzpM63ikRfN41DNIhSgzboELOM}}
\label{fittingALineByLSR}

\index{least squares regression|(}

Fitting linear models by eye is open to criticism since it is based on an individual preference. In this section, we use \emph{least squares regression} as a more rigorous approach.

This section considers family income and gift aid data from a random sample of fifty students in the 2011 freshman class of Elmhurst College in Illinois.\footnote{These data were sampled from a table of data for all freshman from the 2011 class at Elmhurst College that accompanied an article titled \emph{What Students Really Pay to Go to College} published online by \emph{The~Chronicle of Higher Education}: \oiRedirect{textbook-chronicle_elmhurst_article}{chronicle.com/article/What-Students-Really-Pay-to-Go/131435}} Gift aid is financial aid that does not need to be paid back, as opposed to a loan. A scatterplot of the data is shown in Figure~\ref{elmhurstScatterW2Lines} along with two linear fits. The lines follow a negative trend in the data; students who have higher family incomes tended to have lower gift aid from the university.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/elmhurstPlots/elmhurstScatterW2Lines}
\caption{Gift aid and family income for a random sample of 50 freshman students from Elmhurst College. Two lines are fit to the data, the solid line being the \emph{least squares line}.}
\label{elmhurstScatterW2Lines}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
Is the correlation positive or negative in Figure~\ref{elmhurstScatterW2Lines}?\footnote{Larger family incomes are associated with lower amounts of aid, so the correlation will be negative. Using a computer, the correlation can be computed: -0.499.}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{An objective measure for finding the best line}

We begin by thinking about what we mean by ``best''. Mathematically, we want a line that has small residuals. Perhaps our criterion could minimize the sum of the residual magnitudes:
\begin{eqnarray}
|e_1| + |e_2| + \dots + |e_n|
\label{sumOfAbsoluteValueOfResiduals}
\end{eqnarray}
which we could accomplish with a computer program. The resulting dashed line shown in Figure~\ref{elmhurstScatterW2Lines} demonstrates this fit can be quite reasonable. However, a more common practice is to choose the line that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals:
\begin{eqnarray}
e_{1}^2 + e_{2}^2 + \dots + e_{n}^2
\label{sumOfSquaresForResiduals}
\end{eqnarray}
The line that minimizes this \term{least squares criterion} is represented as the solid line in Figure~\ref{elmhurstScatterW2Lines}. This is commonly called the \term{least squares line}. The following are three possible reasons to choose Criterion~\eqref{sumOfSquaresForResiduals} over Criterion~\eqref{sumOfAbsoluteValueOfResiduals}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is the most commonly used method.
\item Computing the line based on Criterion~\eqref{sumOfSquaresForResiduals} is much easier by hand and in most statistical software.
\item In many applications, a residual twice as large as another residual is more than twice as bad. For example, being off by 4 is usually more than twice as bad as being off by 2. Squaring the residuals accounts for this discrepancy.
\end{enumerate}
The first two reasons are largely for tradition and convenience; the last reason explains why Criterion~\eqref{sumOfSquaresForResiduals} is typically most helpful.\footnote{There are applications where Criterion~\eqref{sumOfAbsoluteValueOfResiduals} may be more useful, and there are plenty of other criteria we might consider. However, this book only applies the least squares criterion.}

\subsection{Conditions for the least squares line}

When fitting a least squares line, we generally require
\begin{description}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[Linearity.] The data should show a linear trend. If there is a nonlinear trend (e.g. left panel of Figure~\ref{whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel}), an advanced regression method from another book or later course should be applied.
\item[Nearly normal residuals.] Generally the residuals must be nearly normal.
When this condition is found to be unreasonable, it is usually because of outliers or concerns about influential points, which we  will discuss in greater depth in Section~\ref{typesOfOutliersInLinearRegression}. An example of non-normal residuals is shown in the second panel of Figure~\ref{whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel}.
\item[Constant variability.] The variability of points around the least squares line remains roughly constant. An example of non-constant variability is shown in the third panel of Figure~\ref{whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel}.
\item[Independent observations.] Be cautious about applying regression to \term{time series} data, which are sequential observations in time such as a stock price each day. Such data may have an underlying structure that should be considered in a model and analysis. An example of a data set where successive observations are not independent is shown in the fourth panel of Figure~\ref{whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel}. There are also other instances where correlations within the data are important, which is further discussed in Chapter~\ref{multipleRegressionAndANOVA}.
\end{description}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel/whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel}
\caption{Four examples showing when the methods in this chapter are insufficient to apply to the data. In the left panel, a straight line does not fit the data. In the second panel, there are outliers; two points on the left are relatively distant from the rest of the data, and one of these points is very far away from the line. In the third panel, the variability of the data around the line increases with larger values of $x$. In the last panel, a time series data set is shown, where successive observations are highly correlated.}
\label{whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
Should we have concerns about applying least squares regression to the Elmhurst data in Figure~\ref{elmhurstScatterW2Lines}?\footnote{The trend appears to be linear, the data fall around the line with no obvious outliers, the variance is roughly constant. These are also not time series observations. Least squares regression can be applied to these data.}
\end{exercise}


\textC{\newpage}


\subsection{Finding the least squares line}
\label{findingTheLeastSquaresLineSection}

For the Elmhurst data, we could write the equation of the least squares regression line as
\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{aid} = \beta_0 + \beta_{1}\times family\_\hspace{0.3mm}income
\end{eqnarray*}
Here the equation is set up to predict gift aid based on a student's family income, which would be useful to students considering Elmhurst. These two values, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, are the \emph{parameters} of the regression line.

As in Chapters~4-6, the parameters are estimated using observed data. In practice, this estimation is done using a computer in the same way that other estimates, like a sample mean, can be estimated using a computer or calculator. However, we can also find the parameter estimates by applying two properties of the least squares line:
\begin{itemize}
\item The slope of the least squares line can be estimated by
\begin{eqnarray}
b_1 = \frac{s_y}{s_x} R
\label{slopeOfLSRLine}
\end{eqnarray}
where $R$ is the correlation between the two variables, and $s_x$ and $s_y$ are the sample standard deviations of the explanatory variable %(variable on the horizontal axis) 
and response% (variable on the vertical axis)
, respectively.
\item If $\bar{x}$ is the mean of the horizontal variable (from the data) and $\bar{y}$ is the mean of the vertical variable, then the point $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$ is on the least squares line.
\end{itemize}
\marginpar[\raggedright\vspace{0.5mm}

\begin{exercise} \label{findingTheSlopeOfTheLSRLineForIncomeAndAid}
Using the summary statistics in Table~\ref{summaryStatsOfSATGPAData}, compute the slope for the regression line of gift aid against family income.\footnote{Apply Equation~\eqref{slopeOfLSRLine} with the summary statistics from Table~\ref{summaryStatsOfSATGPAData} to compute the slope:
\begin{eqnarray*}
b_1 = \frac{s_y}{s_x} R = \frac{5.46}{63.2}(-0.499) = -0.0431
\end{eqnarray*}\vspace{-3mm}}
\end{exercise}

You might recall the \term{point-slope} form of a line from math class (another common form is \emph{slope-intercept}). Given the slope of a line and a point on the line, $(x_0, y_0)$, the equation for the line can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
y - y_0 = slope\times (x - x_0)
\label{pointSlopeFormForALine}
\end{eqnarray}
A common exercise to become more familiar with foundations of least squares regression is to use basic summary statistics and point-slope form to produce the least squares line. 

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Identifying the least squares line from summary statistics}
To identify the least squares line from summary statistics:\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Estimate the slope parameter, $b_1$, using Equation~\eqref{slopeOfLSRLine}.
\item Noting that the point $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$ is on the least squares line, use $x_0=\bar{x}$ and $y_0=\bar{y}$ along with the slope $b_1$ in the point-slope equation:
$$y - \bar{y} = b_1 (x - \bar{x}) $$
\item Simplify the equation.\vspace{0.5mm}
\end{itemize}}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{example}{Using the point $(101.8, 19.94)$ from the sample means and the slope estimate $b_1 = -0.0431$ from Guided Practice~\ref{findingTheSlopeOfTheLSRLineForIncomeAndAid}, find the least-squares line for predicting aid based on family income.} \label{exampleToFindLSRLineOfElmhurstData}
Apply the point-slope equation using $(101.8, 19.94)$ and the slope $b_1 = -0.0431$:
\begin{align*}
y - y_0     &= b_1 (x - x_0) \\
y - 19.94  &= -0.0431(x - 101.8)
\end{align*}
Expanding the right side and then adding 19.94 to each side, the equation simplifies:
$$ \widehat{aid} = 24.3 - 0.0431 \times family\_\hspace{0.3mm}income $$
Here we have replaced $y$ with $\widehat{aid}$ and $x$ with $family\_\hspace{0.3mm}income$ to put the equation in context.
\end{example}

We mentioned earlier that a computer is usually used to compute the least squares line. A summary table based on computer output is shown in Table~\ref{rOutputForIncomeAidLSRLine} for the Elmhurst data. The first column of numbers provides estimates for ${b}_0$ and ${b}_1$, respectively. Compare these to the result from Example~\ref{exampleToFindLSRLineOfElmhurstData}.

\begin{example}{Examine the second, third, and fourth columns in Table~\ref{rOutputForIncomeAidLSRLine}. Can you guess what they represent?}
We'll describe the meaning of the columns using the second row, which corresponds to~$\beta_1$. The first column provides the point estimate for $\beta_1$, as we calculated in an earlier example: -0.0431. The second column is a standard error for this point estimate: 0.0108. The third column is a $t$-test statistic for the null hypothesis that $\beta_1 = 0$: $T=-3.98$. The last column is the p-value for the $t$-test statistic for the null hypothesis $\beta_1=0$ and a two-sided alternative hypothesis: 0.0002. We will get into more of these details in Section~\ref{inferenceForLinearRegression}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{Suppose a high school senior is considering Elmhurst College. Can she simply use the linear equation that we have estimated to calculate her financial aid from the university?}
She may use it as an estimate, though some qualifiers on this approach are important. First, the data all come from one freshman class, and the way aid is determined by the university may change from year to year. Second, the equation will provide an imperfect estimate. While the linear equation is good at capturing the trend in the data, no individual student's aid will be perfectly predicted.

\subsection{Interpreting regression line parameter estimates}

\index{least squares regression!interpreting parameters|(}

Interpreting parameters in a regression model is often one of the most important steps in the analysis.

\begin{example}{The slope and intercept estimates for the Elmhurst data are -0.0431 and 24.3. What do these numbers really mean?}
Interpreting the slope parameter is helpful in almost any application. For each additional \$1,000 of family income, we would expect a student to receive a net difference of $\$\text{1,000}\times (-0.0431) = -\$43.10$ in aid on average, i.e. \$43.10 \emph{less}. Note that a higher family income corresponds to less aid because the coefficient of family income is negative in the model. We must be cautious in this interpretation: while there is a real association, we cannot interpret a causal connection between the variables because these data are observational. That is, increasing a student's family income may not cause the student's aid to drop. (It would be reasonable to contact the college and ask if the relationship is causal, i.e. if Elmhurst College's aid decisions are partially based on students' family income.)

The estimated intercept $b_0=24.3$ (in \$1000s) describes the average aid if a student's family had no income. The meaning of the intercept is relevant to this application since the family income for some students at Elmhurst is \$0. In other applications, the intercept may have little or no practical value if there are no observations where $x$ is near zero.
\end{example}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Interpreting parameters estimated by least squares}
The slope describes the estimated difference in the $y$ variable if the explanatory variable $x$ for a case happened to be one unit larger. The intercept describes the average outcome of $y$ if $x=0$ \emph{and} the linear model is valid all the way to $x=0$, which in many applications is not the case.}
\index{least squares regression!interpreting parameters|)}
\end{termBox}

\subsection{Extrapolation is treacherous}

\index{least squares regression!extrapolation|(}

{\em\small When those blizzards hit the East Coast this winter, it proved to my satisfaction that global warming was a fraud. That snow was freezing cold. But in an alarming trend, temperatures this spring have risen. Consider this: On February $6^{th}$ it was 10 degrees. Today it hit almost 80. At this rate, by August it will be 220 degrees. So clearly folks the climate debate rages on.\vspace{0.5mm}}

\noindent\hspace{\textwidth}\hspace{-40mm}Stephen Colbert

\noindent\hspace{\textwidth}\hspace{-40mm}April 6th, 2010\footnote{\oiRedirect{textbook-colbert_extrapolation}{www.cc.com/video-clips/l4nkoq}} \\

Linear models can be used to approximate the relationship between two variables. However, these models have real limitations. Linear regression is simply a modeling framework. The truth is almost always much more complex than our simple line. For example, we do not know how the data outside of our limited window will behave.

\textC{\pagebreak}

\begin{example}{Use the model $\widehat{aid} = 24.3 - 0.0431\times family\_\hspace{0.3mm}income$ to estimate the aid of another freshman student whose family had income of \$1 million.}
Recall that the units of family income are in \$1000s, so we want to calculate the aid for $family\_\hspace{0.3mm}income = 1000$:
\begin{align*}
24.3 - 0.0431\times family\_\hspace{0.3mm}income  = 24.3 - 0.0431\times 1000 = -18.8
\end{align*}
The model predicts this student will have -\$18,800 in aid (!). Elmhurst College cannot (or at least does not) require any students to pay extra on top of tuition to attend.
\end{example}

Applying a model estimate to values outside of the realm of the original data is called \term{extrapolation}. Generally, a linear model is only an approximation of the real relationship between two variables. If we extrapolate, we are making an unreliable bet that the approximate linear relationship will be valid in places where it has not been analyzed.

\index{least squares regression!extrapolation|)}

\subsection{Using $R^2$ to describe the strength of a fit}

\index{least squares regression!R-squared ($R^2$)|(}

We evaluated the strength of the linear relationship between two variables earlier using the correlation, $R$. However, it is more common to explain the strength of a linear fit using $R^2$, called \termsub{R-squared}{least squares regression!R-squared ($R^2$)}. If provided with a linear model, we might like to describe how closely the data cluster around the linear fit.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/elmhurstPlots/elmhurstScatterWLSROnly}
\caption{Gift aid and family income for a random sample of 50 freshman students from Elmhurst College, shown with the least squares regression line.}
\label{elmhurstScatterWLSROnly}
\end{figure}

The $R^2$ of a linear model describes the amount of variation in the response that is explained by the least squares line. For example, consider the Elmhurst data, shown in Figure~\ref{elmhurstScatterWLSROnly}. The variance of the response variable, aid received, is $s_{aid}^2=29.8$. However, if we apply our least squares line, then this model reduces our uncertainty in predicting aid using a student's family income. The variability in the residuals describes how much variation remains after using the model: $s_{_{RES}}^2 = 22.4$. In short, there was a reduction of
$$\frac{s_{aid}^2 - s_{_{RES}}^2}{s_{aid}^2}
	= \frac{29.8 - 22.4}{29.8} = \frac{7.5}{29.8}
	= 0.25$$
or about  25\% in the data's variation by using information about family income for predicting aid using a linear model. This corresponds exactly to the R-squared value:
\begin{align*}
R &= -0.499 &R^2 &= 0.25
\end{align*}

\begin{exercise}
If a linear model has a very strong negative relationship with a correlation of -0.97, how much of the variation in the response is explained by the explanatory variable?\footnote{About $R^2 = (-0.97)^2 = 0.94$ or 94\% of the variation is explained by the linear model.}
\index{least squares regression!R-squared ($R^2$)|)}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Categorical predictors with two levels}
\label{categoricalPredictorsWithTwoLevels}

Categorical variables are also useful in predicting outcomes. Here we consider a categorical predictor with two levels (recall that a \emph{level} is the same as a \emph{category}). We'll consider Ebay auctions for a video game, \emph{Mario Kart} for the Nintendo Wii, where both the total price of the auction and the condition of the game were recorded.\footnote{These data were collected in Fall 2009 and may be found at \oiRedirect{textbook-openintro}{openintro.org}.} Here we want to predict total price based on game condition, which takes values \resp{used} and \resp{new}. A plot of the auction data is shown in Figure~\ref{marioKartNewUsed}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/marioKartNewUsed/marioKartNewUsed}
\caption{Total auction prices for the video game \emph{Mario Kart}, divided into used ($x=0$) and new ($x=1$) condition games. The least squares regression line is also shown.}
\label{marioKartNewUsed}
\end{figure}

To incorporate the game condition variable into a regression equation, we must convert the categories into a numerical form. We will do so using an \term{indicator variable} called \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new}, which takes value 1 when the game is new and 0 when the game is used. Using this indicator variable, the linear model may be written as
\begin{align*}
\widehat{price} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{\var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new}}
\end{align*}
The fitted model is summarized in Table~\ref{marioKartNewUsedRegrSummary}, and the model with its parameter estimates is given as
\begin{align*}
\widehat{price} = 42.87 + 10.90 \times \text{\var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new}}
\end{align*}
For categorical predictors with just two levels, the linearity assumption will always be satisfied. However, we must evaluate whether the residuals in each group are approximately normal and have approximately equal variance. As can be seen in Figure~\ref{marioKartNewUsed}, both of these conditions are reasonably satisfied by the auction data.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}
  \hline
  \vspace{-3.7mm} & & & & \\
 & Estimate & Std. Error & t value & Pr($>$$|$t$|$) \\ 
  \hline
  \vspace{-3.6mm} & & & & \\
(Intercept) & 42.87 & 0.81 & 52.67 & 0.0000 \\ 
  cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new & 10.90 & 1.26 & 8.66 & 0.0000 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Least squares regression summary for the final auction price against the condition of the game.}
\label{marioKartNewUsedRegrSummary}
\end{table}

\begin{example}{Interpret the two parameters estimated in the model for the price of \emph{Mario Kart} in eBay auctions.}
The intercept is the estimated price when \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new} takes value 0, i.e. when the game is in used condition. That is, the average selling price of a used version of the game is \$42.87.

The slope indicates that, on average, new games sell for about \$10.90 more than used games.
\end{example}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Interpreting model estimates for categorical predictors.}
The estimated intercept is the value of the response variable for the first category (i.e. the category corresponding to an indicator value of 0). The estimated slope is the average change in the response variable between the two categories.}
\end{tipBox}

\MultipleRegression{We'll elaborate further on this Ebay auction data in Chapter~\ref{multipleRegressionAndANOVA}, where we examine the influence of many predictor variables simultaneously using multiple regression\index{multiple regression}. In multiple regression, we will consider the association of auction price with regard to each variable while controlling for the influence of other variables. This is especially important since some of the predictors are associated. For example, auctions with games in new condition also often came with more accessories.}{}

\section[Types of outliers in linear regression]{Types of outliers in linear regression \sectionvideohref{youtube-jZEKAlo1E54&list=PLkIselvEzpM63ikRfN41DNIhSgzboELOM}}
\label{typesOfOutliersInLinearRegression}

In this section, we identify criteria for determining which outliers are important and influential. Outliers in regression are observations that fall far from the ``cloud'' of points. These points are especially important because they can have a strong influence on the least squares line. 

\begin{example}{There are six plots shown in Figure~\ref{outlierPlots} along with the least squares line and residual plots. For each scatterplot and residual plot pair, identify the outliers and note how they influence the least squares line. Recall that an outlier is any point that doesn't appear to belong with the vast majority of the other points.}\label{outlierPlotsExample}
\begin{itemize}
%\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[(1)] There is one outlier far from the other points, though it only appears to slightly influence the line.
\item[(2)] There is one outlier on the right, though it is quite close to the least squares line, which suggests it wasn't very influential.
\item[(3)] There is one point far away from the cloud, and this outlier appears to pull the least squares line up on the right; examine how the line around the primary cloud doesn't appear to fit very well.
\item[(4)] There is a primary cloud and then a small secondary cloud of four outliers. The secondary cloud appears to be influencing the line somewhat strongly, making the least square line fit poorly almost everywhere. There might be an interesting explanation for the dual clouds, which is something that could be investigated.
\item[(5)] There is no obvious trend in the main cloud of points and the outlier on the right appears to largely control the slope of the least squares line.
\item[(6)] There is one outlier far from the cloud, however, it falls quite close to the least squares line and does not appear to be very influential.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/outlierPlots/outlierPlots}
\caption{Six plots, each with a least squares line and residual plot. All data sets have at least one outlier.}
\label{outlierPlots}
\end{figure}

Examine the residual plots in Figure~\ref{outlierPlots}. You will probably find that there is some trend in the main clouds of (3) and (4). In these cases, the outliers influenced the slope of the least squares lines. In (5), data with no clear trend were assigned a line with a large trend simply due to one outlier (!).
 
 \begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Leverage}
Points that fall horizontally away from the center of the cloud tend to pull harder on the line, so we call them points with \term{high leverage}.}
\end{termBox}

Points that fall horizontally far from the line are points of high leverage; these points can strongly influence the slope of the least squares line. If one of these high leverage points does appear to actually invoke its influence on the slope of the line -- as in cases (3), (4), and (5) of Example~\ref{outlierPlotsExample} -- then we call it an \term{influential point}. Usually we can say a point is influential if, had we fitted the line without it, the influential point would have been unusually far from the least squares line.

It is tempting to remove outliers. Don't do this without a very good reason. Models that ignore exceptional (and interesting) cases often perform poorly. For instance, if a financial firm ignored the largest market swings -- the ``outliers'' --  they would soon go bankrupt by making poorly thought-out investments.

\begin{caution}{Don't ignore outliers when fitting a final model}
{If there are outliers in the data, they should not be removed or ignored without a~good reason. Whatever final model is fit to the data would not be very helpful if it ignores the most exceptional cases.}
\end{caution}

\begin{caution}{Outliers for a categorical predictor with two levels}{
Be cautious about using a categorical predictor when one of the levels has very few observations. When this happens, those few observations become influential points.}
\end{caution}

\label{inferenceForLinearRegression}

In this section we discuss uncertainty in the estimates of the slope and y-intercept for a regression line. Just as we identified standard errors for point estimates in previous chapters, we first discuss standard errors for these new estimates. However, in the case of regression, we will identify standard errors using statistical software.

\subsection{Midterm elections and unemployment}

\index{data!midterm elections|(}

Elections for members of the United States House of Representatives occur every two years, coinciding every four years with the U.S. Presidential election. The set of House elections occurring during the middle of a Presidential term are called \indexthis{midterm elections}{midterm election}. In America's two-party system, one political theory suggests the higher the unemployment rate, the worse the President's party will do in the midterm elections.

To assess the validity of this claim, we can compile historical data and look for a connection. We consider every midterm election from 1898 to 2010, with the exception of those elections during the Great Depression. Figure~\ref{unemploymentAndChangeInHouse} shows these data and the least-squares regression line: \vspace{-2mm}
\begin{align*}
&\text{\% change in House seats for President's party}  \\
&\qquad\qquad= -6.71 - 1.00\times \text{(unemployment rate)}
\end{align*}
We consider the percent change in the number of seats of the President's party (e.g. percent change in the number of seats for Democrats in 2010) against the unemployment rate.

Examining the data, there are no clear deviations from linearity, the constant variance condition, or in the normality of residuals (though we don't examine a normal probability plot here). While the data are collected sequentially, a separate analysis was used to check for any apparent correlation between successive observations; no such correlation was found.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/unemploymentAndChangeInHouse/unemploymentAndChangeInHouse}
\caption{The percent change in House seats for the President's party in each election from 1898 to 2010 plotted against the unemployment rate. The two points for the Great Depression have been removed, and a least squares regression line has been fit to the data.}
\label{unemploymentAndChangeInHouse}
\end{figure}

\textC{\newpage}

\begin{exercise}
The data for the Great Depression (1934 and 1938) were removed because the unemployment rate was 21\% and 18\%, respectively. Do you agree that they should be removed for this investigation? Why or why not?\footnote{We will provide two considerations. Each of these points would have very high leverage on any least-squares regression line, and years with such high unemployment may not help us understand what would happen in other years where the unemployment is only modestly high. On the other hand, these are exceptional cases, and we would be discarding important information if we exclude them from a final analysis.}
\end{exercise}

There is a negative slope in the line shown in Figure~\ref{unemploymentAndChangeInHouse}. However, this slope (and the y-intercept) are only estimates of the parameter values. We might wonder, is this convincing evidence that the ``true'' linear model has a negative slope? That is, do the data provide strong evidence that the political theory is accurate? We can frame this investigation into a one-sided statistical hypothesis test:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$H_0$:] $\beta_1 = 0$. The true linear model has slope zero.
\item[$H_A$:] $\beta_1 < 0$. The true linear model has a slope less than zero. The higher the unemployment, the greater the loss for the President's party in the House of Representatives.
\end{itemize}
We would reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_A$ if the data provide strong evidence that the true slope parameter is less than zero. To assess the hypotheses, we identify a standard error for the estimate, compute an appropriate test statistic, and identify the p-value.


\textC{\newpage}


\subsection{Understanding regression output from software}
\label{testStatisticForTheSlope}

Just like other point estimates we have seen before, we can compute a standard error and test statistic for $b_1$. We will generally label the test statistic using a $T$, since it follows the $t$-distribution.

We will rely on statistical software to compute the standard error and leave the explanation of how this standard error is determined to a second or third statistics course. Table~\ref{midtermElectionUnemploymentRRegressionOutput} shows software output for the least squares regression line in Figure~\ref{unemploymentAndChangeInHouse}. The row labeled \emph{unemp} represents the information for the slope, which is the coefficient of the unemployment variable.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}
  \hline
  \vspace{-3.7mm} & & & & \\
 & Estimate & Std. Error & t value & Pr($>$$|$t$|$) \\ 
  \hline
  \vspace{-3.6mm} & & & & \\
(Intercept) & -6.7142 & 5.4567 & -1.23 & 0.2300 \\ 
  unemp & -1.0010 & 0.8717 & -1.15 & 0.2617 \\ 
   \hline
   \multicolumn{5}{r}{$df=25$} \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Output from statistical software for the regression line modeling the midterm election losses for the President's party as a response to unemployment.}
\label{midtermElectionUnemploymentRRegressionOutput}
\end{table}

\begin{example}{What do the first and second columns of Table~\ref{midtermElectionUnemploymentRRegressionOutput} represent?}
The entries in the first column represent the least squares estimates, $b_0$ and $b_1$, and the values in the second column correspond to the standard errors of each estimate.
\end{example}

We previously used a $t$-test statistic for hypothesis testing in the context of numerical data. Regression is very similar. In the hypotheses we consider, the null value for the slope is 0, so we can compute the test statistic using the T (or Z) score formula:
\begin{align*}
T = \frac{\text{estimate} - \text{null value}}{\text{SE}} = \frac{-1.0010 - 0}{0.8717} = -1.15
\end{align*}
We can look for the one-sided p-value -- shown in Figure~\ref{oneSidedTailForMidtermUnemploymentHT} -- using the probability table for the $t$-distribution in Appendix~\ref{tDistributionTable} on page~\pageref{tDistributionTable}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.82\textwidth]{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/oneSidedTailForMidtermUnemploymentHT/oneSidedTailForMidtermUnemploymentHT}
\caption{The distribution shown here is the sampling distribution for $b_1$, if the null hypothesis was true. The shaded tail represents the p-value for the hypothesis test evaluating whether there is convincing evidence that higher unemployment corresponds to a greater loss of House seats for the President's party during a midterm election.}
\label{oneSidedTailForMidtermUnemploymentHT}
\end{figure}

\textC{\newpage}

\begin{example}{Table~\ref{midtermElectionUnemploymentRRegressionOutput} offers the degrees of freedom for the test statistic $T$: $df=25$. Identify the p-value for the hypothesis test.}
Looking in the 25 degrees of freedom row in Appendix~\ref{tDistributionTable}, we see that the absolute value of the test statistic is smaller than any value listed, which means the tail area and therefore also the p-value is larger than 0.100 (one tail!). Because the p-value is so large, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. That is, the data do not provide convincing evidence that a higher unemployment rate has any correspondence with smaller or larger losses for the President's party in the House of Representatives in midterm elections.
\index{data!midterm elections|)}
\end{example}

We could have identified the $t$-test statistic from the software output in Table~\ref{midtermElectionUnemploymentRRegressionOutput}, shown in the second row (unemp) and third column (t value). The entry in the second row and last column in Table~\ref{midtermElectionUnemploymentRRegressionOutput} represents the p-value for the two-sided hypothesis test where the null value is zero. The corresponding one-sided test would have a p-value half of the listed value.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Inference for regression}
We usually rely on statistical software to identify point estimates and standard errors for parameters of a regression line. After verifying conditions hold for fitting a line, we can use the methods learned in Section~\ref{oneSampleMeansWithTDistribution} for the $t$-distribution to create confidence intervals for regression parameters or to evaluate hypothesis tests.}
\end{termBox}

\begin{caution}{Don't carelessly use the p-value from regression output}{The last column in regression output often lists p-values for one particular hypothesis: a two-sided test where the null value is zero. If your test is one-sided and the point estimate is in the direction of $H_A$, then you can halve the software's p-value to get the one-tail area. If neither of these scenarios match your hypothesis test, be cautious about using the software output to obtain the p-value.}
\end{caution}

\begin{example}{Examine Figure~\vref{elmhurstScatterWLSROnly}, which relates the Elmhurst College aid and student family income. How sure are you that the slope is statistically significantly different from zero? That is, do you think a formal hypothesis test would reject the claim that the true slope of the line should be zero?} \label{overallAidIncomeInformalAssessmentOfRegressionLineSlope}
While the relationship between the variables is not perfect, there is an evident decreasing trend in the data. This suggests the hypothesis test will reject the null claim that the slope is zero.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Table~\ref{rOutputForIncomeAidLSRLineInInferenceSection} shows statistical software output from fitting the least squares regression line shown in Figure~\ref{elmhurstScatterWLSROnly}. Use this output to formally evaluate the following hypotheses. $H_0$: The true coefficient for family income is zero. $H_A$: The true coefficient for family income is not zero.\footnote{We look in the second row corresponding to the family income variable. We see the point estimate of the slope of the line is -0.0431, the standard error of this estimate is 0.0108, and the $t$-test statistic is -3.98. The p-value corresponds exactly to the two-sided test we are interested in: 0.0002. The p-value is so small that we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that family income and financial aid at Elmhurst College for freshman entering in the year 2011 are negatively correlated and the true slope parameter is indeed less than 0, just as we believed in Example~\ref{overallAidIncomeInformalAssessmentOfRegressionLineSlope}.}

\eoce{\qt{Rate my professor\label{rate_my_prof}} Many college courses conclude by 
giving students the opportunity to evaluate the course and the instructor 
anonymously. However, the use of these student evaluations as an indicator of 
course quality and teaching effectiveness is often criticized because these 
measures may reflect the influence of non-teaching related characteristics, such 
as the physical appearance of the instructor. Researchers at University of Texas, 
Austin collected data on teaching evaluation score (higher score means better) 
and standardized beauty score (a score of 0 means average, negative score means 
below average, and a positive score means above average) for a sample of 463

\label{multipleAndLogisticRegression}

The principles of simple linear regression lay the foundation for more sophisticated regression methods used in a wide range of challenging settings. In Chapter~\ref{multipleAndLogisticRegression}, we explore multiple regression, which introduces the possibility of more than one predictor, and logistic regression, a technique for predicting categorical outcomes with two possible categories.

\label{introductionToMultipleRegression}

\index{multiple regression|(}

Multiple regression extends simple two-variable regression to the case that still has one response but many predictors (denoted $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, ...). The method is motivated by scenarios where many variables may be simultaneously connected to an output.

\index{data!mario\_kart|(}

We will consider Ebay auctions of a video game called \emph{Mario Kart} for the Nintendo Wii. The outcome variable of interest is the total price of an auction, which is the highest bid plus the shipping cost. We will try to determine how total price is related to each characteristic in an auction while simultaneously controlling for other variables. For instance, all other characteristics held constant, are longer auctions associated with higher or lower prices? And, on average, how much more do buyers tend to pay for additional Wii wheels (plastic steering wheels that attach to the Wii controller) in auctions? Multiple regression will help us answer these and other questions.

The data set \data{mario\_\hspace{0.3mm}kart} includes results from 141 auctions.\footnote{Diez DM, Barr CD, \c{C}etinkaya-Rundel M. 2015. \texttt{openintro}: OpenIntro data sets and supplement functions. \oiRedirect{textbook-github_openintro}{github.com/OpenIntroOrg/openintro-r-package}.} Four observations from this data set are shown in Table~\ref{marioKartDataMatrix}, and descriptions for each variable are shown in Table~\ref{marioKartVariables}. Notice that the condition and stock photo variables are indicator variables\index{indicator variable}. For instance, the \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new} variable takes value 1 if the game up for auction is new and 0 if it is used. Using indicator variables in place of category names allows for these variables to be directly used in regression. See Section~\ref{categoricalPredictorsWithTwoLevels} for additional details. Multiple regression also allows for categorical variables with many levels, though we do not have any such variables in this analysis, and we save these details for a second or third course.

\subsection{A single-variable model for the Mario Kart data}
\label{twoSingleVariableModelsForMarioKartData}

Let's fit a linear regression model with the game's condition as a predictor of auction price. The model may be written as
\begin{align*}
\widehat{price} &= 42.87 + 10.90\times cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new
\end{align*}
Results of this model are shown in Table~\ref{singleVarModelsForPriceUsingCond} and a scatterplot for price versus game condition is shown in Figure~\ref{marioKartSingle}.

\begin{example}{Interpret the coefficient for the game's condition in the model. Is this coefficient significantly different from 0?}
Note that \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new} is a two-level categorical variable that takes value 1 when the game is new and value 0 when the game is used. So 10.90 means that the model predicts an extra \$10.90 for those games that are new versus those that are used. (See Section~\ref{categoricalPredictorsWithTwoLevels} for a review of the interpretation for two-level categorical predictor variables.) Examining the regression output in Table~\ref{singleVarModelsForPriceUsingCond}, we can see that the p-value for \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new} is very close to zero, indicating there is strong evidence that the coefficient is different from zero when using this simple one-variable model.
\end{example}

\subsection{Including and assessing many variables in a model}
\label{includingAndAssessingManyVariablesInAModel}

Sometimes there are underlying structures or relationships between predictor variables. For instance, new games sold on Ebay tend to come with more Wii wheels, which may have led to higher prices for those auctions. We would like to fit a model that includes all potentially important variables simultaneously. This would help us evaluate the relationship between a predictor variable and the outcome while controlling for the potential influence of other variables. This is the strategy used in \term{multiple regression}. While we remain cautious about making any causal interpretations using multiple regression, such models are a common first step in providing evidence of a causal connection.

\textC{\pagebreak}

We want to construct a model that accounts for not only the game condition, as in Section~\ref{twoSingleVariableModelsForMarioKartData}, but simultaneously accounts for three other variables: \var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo}, \var{duration}, and \var{wheels}.
\begin{align}
\widehat{\var{price}}
	&= \beta_0 + \beta_1\times \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new} +
		\beta_2\times \var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo} \notag \\
	&\qquad\  + \beta_3 \times  \var{duration} +
		\beta_4 \times  \var{wheels} \notag \\
\hat{y}
	&= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 +
		\beta_3 x_3 + \beta_4 x_4
\label{eqForMultipleRegrOfTotalPrForAllPredictors}
\end{align}
In this equation, $y$ represents the total price, $x_1$ indicates whether the game is new, $x_2$ indicates whether a stock photo was used, $x_3$ is the duration of the auction, and $x_4$ is the number of Wii wheels included with the game. Just as with the single predictor case, a multiple regression model may be missing important components or it might not precisely represent the relationship between the outcome and the available explanatory variables. While no model is perfect, we wish to explore the possibility that this one may fit the data reasonably well.

We estimate the parameters $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, ..., $\beta_4$ in the same way as we did in the case of a single predictor. We select $b_0$, $b_1$, ..., $b_4$ that minimize the sum of the squared residuals:
\begin{align}\label{sumOfSqResInMultRegr}
SSE = e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \dots + e_{141}^2
	= \sum_{i=1}^{141} e_i^2
	 = \sum_{i=1}^{141} \left(y_i - \hat{y}_i\right)^2
\end{align}
Here there are 141 residuals, one for each observation. We typically use a computer to minimize the sum in Equation~\eqref{sumOfSqResInMultRegr} and compute point estimates, as shown in the sample output in Table~\ref{outputForMultipleRegrOutputForAllPredictors}. Using this output, we identify the point estimates $b_i$ of each $\beta_i$, just as we did in the one-predictor case.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Multiple regression model}
A multiple regression model is a linear model with many predictors. In general, we write the model as
\begin{align*}
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_k x_k %+ \epsilon
\end{align*}
when there are $k$ predictors. We often estimate the $\beta_i$ parameters using a computer.\vspace{1mm}}

Write out the model in Equation~\eqref{eqForMultipleRegrOfTotalPrForAllPredictors} using the point estimates from Table~\ref{outputForMultipleRegrOutputForAllPredictors}. How many predictors are there in this model?\footnote{$\hat{y} = 36.21 + 5.13x_1 + 1.08x_2 - 0.03x_3 + 7.29x_4$, and there are $k=4$ predictor variables.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What does $\beta_4$, the coefficient of variable $x_4$ (Wii wheels), represent? What is the point estimate of $\beta_4$?\footnote{It is the average difference in auction price for each additional Wii wheel included when holding the other variables constant. The point estimate is $b_4 = 7.29$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} \label{computeMultipleRegressionResidualForMarioKart}
Compute the residual of the first observation in Table~\vref{marioKartDataMatrix} using the equation identified in Guided Practice~\ref{eqForMultipleRegrOfTotalPrForAllPredictorsWithCoefficients}.\footnote{$e_i = y_i - \hat{y_i} = 51.55 - 49.62 = 1.93$, where 49.62 was computed using the variables values from the observation and the equation identified in Guided Practice~\ref{eqForMultipleRegrOfTotalPrForAllPredictorsWithCoefficients}.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{We estimated a coefficient for \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new} in Section~\ref{twoSingleVariableModelsForMarioKartData} of $b_1 = 10.90$ with a standard error of $SE_{b_1} = 1.26$ when using simple linear regression. Why might there be a difference between that estimate and the one in the multiple regression setting?} \label{colinearityOfCondNewAndStockPhoto}
If we examined the data carefully, we would see that some predictors are correlated. For instance, when we estimated the connection of the outcome \var{price} and predictor \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new} using simple linear regression, we were unable to control for other variables like the number of Wii wheels included in the auction. That model was biased by the confounding variable \var{wheels}. When we use both variables, this particular underlying and unintentional bias is reduced or eliminated (though bias from other confounding variables may still remain).
\end{example}

Example~\ref{colinearityOfCondNewAndStockPhoto} describes a common issue in multiple regression: correlation among predictor variables. We say the two predictor variables are \term{collinear} (pronounced as \emph{co-linear}) when they are correlated, and this collinearity complicates model estimation. While it is impossible to prevent collinearity from arising in observational data, experiments are usually designed to prevent predictors from being collinear.

\begin{exercise}
The estimated value of the intercept is 36.21, and one might be tempted to make some interpretation of this coefficient, such as, it is the model's predicted price when each of the variables take value zero: the game is used, the primary image is not a stock photo, the auction duration is zero days, and there are no wheels included. Is there any value gained by making this interpretation?\footnote{Three of the variables (\var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new}, \var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo}, and \var{wheels}) do take value 0, but the auction duration is always one or more days. If the auction is not up for any days, then no one can bid on it! That means the total auction price would always be zero for such an auction; the interpretation of the intercept in this setting is not insightful.}
\end{exercise}


\subsection{Adjusted $R^2$ as a better estimate of explained variance}

\index{adjusted r squared@adjusted $R^2$ ($R_{adj}^2$)|(}

We first used $R^2$ in Section~\ref{fittingALineByLSR} to determine the amount of variability in the response that was explained by the model:
\begin{align*}
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{variability in residuals}}{\text{variability in the outcome}}
	= 1 - \frac{Var(e_i)}{Var(y_i)}
\end{align*}
where $e_i$ represents the residuals of the model and $y_i$ the outcomes. This equation remains valid in the multiple regression framework, but a small enhancement can often be even more informative.

\begin{exercise} \label{computeUnadjustedR2ForAllPredictorsInMarioKart}
The variance of the residuals for the model given in Guided Practice~\ref{computeMultipleRegressionResidualForMarioKart} is 23.34, and the variance of the total price in all the auctions is 83.06. Calculate $R^2$ for this model.\footnote{$R^2 = 1 - \frac{23.34}{83.06} = 0.719$.}
\end{exercise}

This strategy for estimating $R^2$ is acceptable when there is just a single variable. However, it becomes less helpful when there are many variables. The regular $R^2$ is a less estimate of the amount of variability explained by the model. To get a better estimate, we use the adjusted $R^2$.

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Adjusted $\mathbf{R^2}$ as a tool for model assessment}
The \termsub{adjusted $\mathbf{R^2}$}{adjusted r squared@adjusted $R^2$ ($R_{adj}^2$)} is computed as
\begin{align*}
R_{adj}^{2} = 1-\frac{Var(e_i) / (n-k-1)}{Var(y_i) / (n-1)}
	= 1-\frac{Var(e_i)}{Var(y_i)} \times \frac{n-1}{n-k-1}
\end{align*}
where $n$ is the number of cases used to fit the model and $k$ is the number of predictor variables in the model.}
\end{termBox}

Because $k$ is never negative, the adjusted $R^2$ will be smaller -- often times just a little smaller -- than the unadjusted $R^2$. The reasoning behind the adjusted $R^2$ lies in the \termsub{degrees of freedom}{degrees of freedom (df)!regression} associated with each variance.\footnote{In multiple regression, the degrees of freedom associated with the variance of the estimate of the residuals is $n-k-1$, not $n-1$. For instance, if we were to make predictions for new data using our current model, we would find that the unadjusted $R^2$ is an overly optimistic estimate of the reduction in variance in the response, and using the degrees of freedom in the adjusted $R^2$ formula helps correct this bias.}

\begin{exercise}
There were $n=141$ auctions in the \data{mario\_\hspace{0.3mm}kart} data set and $k=4$ predictor variables in the model. Use $n$, $k$, and the variances from Guided Practice~\ref{computeUnadjustedR2ForAllPredictorsInMarioKart} to calculate $R_{adj}^2$ for the Mario Kart model.\footnote{$R_{adj}^2 = 1 - \frac{23.34}{83.06}\times \frac{141-1}{141-4-1} = 0.711$.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Suppose you added another predictor to the model, but the variance of the errors $Var(e_i)$ didn't go down. What would happen to the $R^2$? What would happen to the adjusted $R^2$?\hspace{0.7mm}\footnote{The unadjusted $R^2$ would stay the same and the adjusted $R^2$ would go down.}
\end{exercise}

Adjusted $R^2$ could have been used in Chapter~\ref{linRegrForTwoVar}. However, when there is only $k = 1$ predictors, adjusted $R^2$ is very close to regular $R^2$, so this nuance isn't typically important when considering only one predictor.

\label{modelSelection}

\index{model selection|(}

The best model is not always the most complicated. Sometimes including variables that are not evidently important can actually reduce the accuracy of predictions. In this section we discuss model selection strategies, which will help us eliminate variables from the model that are found to be less important.

In practice, the model that includes all available explanatory variables is often referred to as the \term{full model}. The full model may not be the best model, and if it isn't, we want to identify a smaller model that is preferable.


\subsection{Identifying variables in the model that may not be helpful}

Adjusted $R^2$ describes the strength of a model fit, and it is a useful tool for evaluating which predictors are adding value to the model, where \emph{adding value} means they are (likely) improving the accuracy in predicting future outcomes.

Let's consider two models, which are shown in Tables~\ref{outputForMultipleRegrOutputForAllPredictors2} and~\ref{marioKartMultipleRegressionModelAllButDuration}. The first table summarizes the full model since it includes all predictors, while the second does not include the \var{duration} variable.

\label{marioKartMultipleRegressionModelAllButDuration}
\end{table}

\begin{example}{Which of the two models is better?}
We compare the adjusted $R^2$ of each model to determine which to choose. Since the first model has an $R^2_{adj}$ smaller than the $R^2_{adj}$ of the second model, we prefer the second model to the first.
\end{example}

Will the model without \var{duration} be better than the model with \var{duration}? We~cannot know for sure, but based on the adjusted $R^2$, this is our best assessment.


\subsection{Two model selection strategies}

Two common strategies for adding or removing variables in a multiple regression model are called \emph{backward elimination} and \emph{forward selection}. These techniques are often referred to as \term{stepwise} model selection strategies, because they add or delete one variable at a time as they ``step'' through the candidate predictors.

\termsub{Backward elimination}{backward elimination} starts with the model that includes all potential predictor variables. Variables are eliminated one-at-a-time from the model until we cannot improve the adjusted $R^2$. The strategy within each elimination step is to eliminate the variable that leads to the largest improvement in adjusted $R^2$.

\begin{example}{Results corresponding to the \emph{full model} for the \data{mario\_\hspace{0.3mm}kart} data are shown in Table~\ref{outputForMultipleRegrOutputForAllPredictors2}. How should we proceed under the backward elimination strategy?} \label{backwardEliminationExampleWMarioKartData}
Our baseline adjusted $R^2$ from the full model is $R^2_{adj} = 0.7108$, and we need to determine whether dropping a predictor will improve the adjusted $R^2$. To check, we fit four models that each drop a different predictor, and we record the adjusted $R^2$ from each:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
Exclude ... &
	\var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new} &
	\var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo} &
	\var{duration} &
	\var{wheels} \\
&
	$R^2_{adj} = 0.6626$ &
	$R^2_{adj} = 0.7107$ &
	$R^2_{adj} = 0.7128$ &
	$R^2_{adj} = 0.3487$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The third model without \var{duration} has the highest adjusted $R^2$ of 0.7128, so we compare it to the adjusted $R^2$ for the full model. Because eliminating \var{duration} leads to a model with a higher adjusted $R^2$, we drop \var{duration} from the model.

Since we eliminated a predictor from the model in the first step, we see whether we should eliminate any additional predictors. Our baseline adjusted $R^2$ is now $R^2_{adj} = 0.7128$. We now fit three new models, which consider eliminating each of the three remaining predictors:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
Exclude \var{duration} and ... &
	\var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new} &
	\var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo} &
	\var{wheels} \\
&
	$R^2_{adj} = 0.6587$ &
	$R^2_{adj} = 0.7124$ &
	$R^2_{adj} = 0.3414$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
None of these models lead to an improvement in adjusted $R^2$, so we do not eliminate any of the remaining predictors. That is, after backward elimination, we are left with the model that keeps \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new}, \var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photos}, and \var{wheels}, which we can summarize using the coefficients from Table~\ref{marioKartMultipleRegressionModelAllButDuration}:
\begin{align*}
\hat{y} \ &= \ b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + b_4x_4 \\
\widehat{price} &= \ 36.05 + 5.18 \times \text{\var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new}} + 1.12 \times \text{\var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo}} + 7.30 \times \text{\var{wheels}}
\end{align*}
\end{example}

\textC{\newpage}

The \term{forward selection} strategy is the reverse of the backward elimination technique. Instead of eliminating variables one-at-a-time, we add variables one-at-a-time until we cannot find any variables that improve the model (as measured by adjusted $R^2$).

\begin{example}{Construct a model for the \data{mario\_\hspace{0.3mm}kart} data set using the forward selection strategy.}\label{forwardEliminationExampleWMarioKartData}
We start with the model that includes no variables. Then we fit each of the possible models with just one variable. That is, we fit the model including just \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new}, then the model including just \var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo}, then a model with just \var{duration}, and a model with just \var{wheels}. Each of the four models provides an adjusted $R^2$ value:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
Add ... &
	\var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new} &
	\var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo} &
	\var{duration} &
	\var{wheels} \\
&
	$R^2_{adj} = 0.3459$ &
	$R^2_{adj} = 0.0332$ &
	$R^2_{adj} = 0.1338$ &
	$R^2_{adj} = 0.6390$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
In this first step, we compare the adjusted $R^2$ against a baseline model that has no predictors. The no-predictors model always has $R_{adj}^2 = 0$. The model with one predictor that has the largest adjusted $R^2$ is the model with the \var{wheels} predictor, and because this adjusted $R^2$ is larger than the adjusted $R^2$ from the model with no predictors ($R_{adj}^2 = 0$), we will add this variable to our model.

We repeat the process again, this time considering 2-predictor models where one of the predictors is \var{wheels} and with a new baseline of $R^2_{adj} = 0.6390$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
Add \var{wheels} and ... &
	\var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new} &
	\var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo} &
	\var{duration} \\
&
	$R^2_{adj} = 0.7124$ &
	$R^2_{adj} = 0.6587$ &
	$R^2_{adj} = 0.6528$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The best predictor in this stage, \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new}, has a higher adjusted $R^2$ (0.7124) than the baseline (0.6390), so we also add \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new} to the model.

Since we have again added a variable to the model, we continue and see whether it would be beneficial to add a third variable:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Add \var{wheels}, \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new}, and ... &
	\var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo} &
	\var{duration} \\
&
	$R^2_{adj} = 0.7128$ &
	$R^2_{adj} = 0.7107$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The model adding \var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo} improved adjusted $R^2$ (0.7124 to 0.7128), so we add \var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo} to the model.

Because we have again added a predictor, we check whether adding the last variable, \var{duration}, will improve adjusted $R^2$. We compare the adjusted $R^2$ for the model with \var{duration} and the other three predictors (0.7108) to the model that only considers \var{wheels}, \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new}, and \var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo} (0.7128). Adding \var{duration} does not improve the adjusted $R^2$, so we do not add it to the model, and we have arrived at the same model that we identified from backward elimination.

\end{example}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Model selection strategies}
Backward elimination begins with the largest model and eliminates variables one-by-one until we are satisfied that all remaining variables are important to the model. Forward selection starts with no variables included in the model, then it adds in variables according to their importance until no other important variables are found.}
\end{termBox}

There is no guarantee that backward elimination and forward selection will arrive at the same final model. If both techniques are tried and they arrive at different models, we choose the model with the larger $R_{adj}^2$; other tie-break options exist but are beyond the scope of this book.



\subsection{The p-value approach, an alternative to adjusted $R^2$}

The p-value may be used as an alternative to adjusted $R^2$ for model selection.

In backward elimination, we would identify the predictor corresponding to the largest p-value. If the p-value is above the significance level, usually $\alpha = 0.05$, then we would drop that variable, refit the model, and repeat the process. If the largest p-value is less than $\alpha = 0.05$, then we would not eliminate any predictors and the current model would be our best-fitting model.

In forward selection with p-values, we reverse the process. We begin with a model that has no predictors, then we fit a model for each possible predictor, identifying the model where the corresponding predictor's p-value is smallest. If that p-value is smaller than $\alpha = 0.05$, we add it to the model and repeat the process, considering whether to add more variables one-at-a-time. When none of the remaining predictors can be added to the model and have a p-value less than 0.05, then we stop adding variables and the current model would be our best-fitting model.

\begin{exercise}
Examine Table~\ref{marioKartMultipleRegressionModelAllButDuration} on page~\pageref{marioKartMultipleRegressionModelAllButDuration}, which considers the model including the \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new}, \var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo}, and \var{wheels} predictors. If we were using the p-value approach with backward elimination and we were considering this model, which of these three variables would be up for elimination? Would we drop that variable, or would we keep it in the model?\footnote{The \var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo} predictor is up for elimination since it has the largest p-value. Additionally, since that p-value is larger than 0.05, we would in fact eliminate \var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo} from the model.}
\end{exercise}

While the adjusted $R^2$ and p-value approaches are similar, they sometimes lead to different models, with the adjusted $R^2$ approach tending to include more predictors in the final model. For example, if we had used the p-value approach with the auction data, we would not have included the \var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo} predictor in the final model.

\begin{tipBox}{\tBoxTitle{When to use the adjusted $R^2$ and when to use the p-value approach}
When the sole goal is to improve prediction accuracy, use adjusted $R^2$. This is commonly the case in machine learning applications.\\[-2mm]

When we care about understanding which variables are statistically significant predictors of the response, or if there is interest in producing a simpler model at the potential cost of a little prediction accuracy, then the p-value approach is preferred.}
\end{tipBox}

Regardless of whether you use adjusted $R^2$ or the p-value approach, or if you use the backward elimination of forward selection strategy, our job is not done after variable selection. We must still verify the model conditions are reasonable.

\index{multiple regression!model assumptions|(}

Multiple regression methods using the model
\begin{align*}
\hat{y} &= \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_kx_k
\end{align*}
generally depend on the following four assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item the residuals of the model are nearly normal,
\item the variability of the residuals is nearly constant,
\item the residuals are independent, and
\item each variable is linearly related to the outcome.
\end{enumerate}
\termsub{Diagnostic plots}{diagnostic plots} can be used to check each of these assumptions. We will consider the model from the Mario Kart auction data, and check whether there are any notable concerns:
\begin{align*}
\widehat{price} &= \ 36.05 + 5.18 \times \text{\var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new}} + 1.12 \times \text{\var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo}} + 7.30 \times \text{\var{wheels}}
\end{align*}

\begin{description}
\item[Normal probability plot.] A normal probability plot of the residuals is shown in Figure~\ref{mkDiagnosticNormalQuantilePlot}. While the plot exhibits some minor irregularities, there are no outliers that might be cause for concern. In a normal probability plot for residuals, we tend to be most worried about residuals that appear to be outliers, since these indicate long tails in the distribution of residuals.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=0.71\textwidth]{ch_regr_mult_and_log/figures/marioKartDiagnostics/mkDiagnosticNormalQuantilePlot}
\caption{A normal probability plot of the residuals is helpful in identifying observations that might be outliers.}
\label{mkDiagnosticNormalQuantilePlot}
\end{figure}

\item[Absolute values of residuals against fitted values.] A plot of the absolute value of the residuals against their corresponding fitted values ($\hat{y}_i$) is shown in Figure~\ref{mkDiagnosticEvsAbsF}. This plot is helpful to check the condition that the variance of the residuals is approximately constant. We don't see any obvious deviations from constant variance in this example.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{ch_regr_mult_and_log/figures/marioKartDiagnostics/mkDiagnosticEvsAbsF}
\caption{Comparing the absolute value of the residuals against the fitted values ($\hat{y}_i$) is helpful in identifying deviations from the constant variance assumption.}
\label{mkDiagnosticEvsAbsF}
\end{figure}

\item[Residuals in order of their data collection.] A plot of the residuals in the order their corresponding auctions were observed is shown in Figure~\ref{mkDiagnosticInOrder}. Such a plot is helpful in identifying any connection between cases that are close to one another, e.g. we could look for declining prices over time or if there was a time of the day when auctions tended to fetch a higher price. Here we see no structure that indicates a problem.\footnote{An especially rigorous check would use \term{time series} methods. For instance, we could check whether consecutive residuals are correlated. Doing so with these residuals yields no statistically significant correlations.}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.72\textwidth]{ch_regr_mult_and_log/figures/marioKartDiagnostics/mkDiagnosticInOrder}
\caption{Plotting residuals in the order that their corresponding observations were collected helps identify connections between successive observations. If it seems that consecutive observations tend to be close to each other, this indicates the independence assumption of the observations would fail.}
\label{mkDiagnosticInOrder}
\end{figure}

\item[Residuals against each predictor variable.] We consider a plot of the residuals against the \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new} variable, the residuals against the \var{stock\_\hspace{0.3mm}photo} variable, and the residuals against the \var{wheels} variable. These plots are shown in Figure~\ref{mkDiagnosticEvsVariables}. For the two-level condition variable, we are guaranteed not to see any remaining trend, and instead we are checking that the variability doesn't fluctuate across groups, which it does not. However, looking at the stock photo variable, we find that there is some difference in the variability of the residuals in the two groups. Additionally, when we consider the residuals against the \var{wheels} variable, we see some possible structure. There appears to be curvature in the residuals, indicating the relationship is probably not linear.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_regr_mult_and_log/figures/marioKartDiagnostics/mkDiagnosticEvsVariables}
\caption{For the condition and stock photo variables, we check for differences in the distribution shape or variability of the residuals. In the case of the stock photos variable, we see a little less variability in the unique photo group than the stock photo group. For numerical predictors, we also check for trends or other structure. We see some slight bowing in the residuals against the \var{wheels} variable in the bottom plot.}
\label{mkDiagnosticEvsVariables}
\end{figure}

\end{description}

It is necessary to summarize diagnostics for any model fit. If the diagnostics support the model assumptions, this would improve credibility in the findings. If the diagnostic assessment shows remaining underlying structure in the residuals, we should try to adjust the model to account for that structure. If we are unable to do so, we may still report the model but must also note its shortcomings. In the case of the auction data, we report that there appears to be non-constant variance in the stock photo variable and that there may be a nonlinear relationship between the total price and the number of wheels included for an auction. This information would be important to buyers and sellers who may review the analysis, and omitting this information could be a setback to the very people who the model might assist.

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle[]{``All models are wrong, but some are useful'' -George E.P. Box}
The truth is that no model is perfect. However, even imperfect models can be useful. Reporting a flawed model can be reasonable so long as we are clear and report the model's shortcomings.}
\end{tipBox}

\begin{caution}
{Don't report results when assumptions are grossly violated}
{While there is a little leeway in model assumptions, don't go too far. If model assumptions are very clearly violated, consider a new model, even if it means learning more statistical methods or hiring someone who can help.}
\end{caution}

\label{logisticRegression}

\index{logistic regression|(}

In this section we introduce \term{logistic regression} as a tool for building models when there is a categorical response variable with two levels. Logistic regression is a type of \term{generalized linear model} (GLM) for response variables where regular multiple regression does not work very well. In particular, the response variable in these settings often takes a form where residuals look completely different from the normal distribution.

GLMs can be thought of as a two-stage modeling approach. We first model the response variable using a probability distribution, such as the binomial or Poisson distribution. Second, we model the parameter of the distribution using a collection of predictors and a special form of multiple regression.

\index{data!email|(}

In Section~\ref{logisticRegression} we will revisit the \data{email} data set from Chapter~\ref{introductionToData}. These emails were collected from a single email account, and we will work on developing a basic spam filter using these data. The response variable, \var{spam}, has been encoded to take value~0 when a message is not spam and~1 when it is spam. Our task will be to build an appropriate model that classifies messages as spam or not spam using email characteristics coded as predictor variables. While this model will not be the same as those used in large-scale spam filters, it shares many of the same features. 

\subsection{Email data}

The \data{email} data set was first presented in Chapter~\ref{introductionToData} with a relatively small number of variables. In fact, there are many more variables available that might be useful for classifying spam. Descriptions of these variables are presented in Table~\ref{emailVariables}. The \var{spam} variable will be the outcome, and the other 10 variables will be the model predictors. While we have limited the predictors used in this section to be categorical variables (where many are represented as indicator variables), numerical predictors may also be used in logistic regression. See the footnote for an additional discussion on this topic.\footnote{Recall from Chapter~\ref{linRegrForTwoVar} that if outliers are present in predictor variables, the corresponding observations may be especially influential on the resulting model. This is the motivation for omitting the numerical variables, such as the number of characters and line breaks in emails, that we saw in Chapter~\ref{introductionToData}. These variables exhibited extreme skew. We could resolve this issue by transforming these variables (e.g. using a log-transformation), but we will omit this further investigation for brevity.}

\begin{table}
\centering\small
\begin{tabular}{lp{10.5cm}}
\hline
{\bf variable} & {\bf description} \\
\hline
\var{spam} & Specifies whether the message was spam. \\
\var{to\_\hspace{0.3mm}multiple} & An indicator variable for if more than one person was listed in the \emph{To} field of the email.  \\
\var{cc} & An indicator for if someone was CCed on the email. \\
\var{attach} & An indicator for if there was an attachment, such as a document or image.   \\
\var{dollar} & An indicator for if the word ``dollar'' or dollar symbol (\$) appeared in the email.  \\
\var{winner} & An indicator for if the word ``winner'' appeared in the email message.  \\
\var{inherit} & An indicator for if the word ``inherit'' (or a variation, like ``inheritance'') appeared in the email.  \\
\var{password} & An indicator for if the word ``password'' was present in the email.  \\
\var{format} & Indicates if the email contained special formatting, such as bolding, tables, or links    \\
\var{re\_\hspace{0.3mm}subj} & Indicates whether ``Re:'' was included at the start of the email subject.   \\
\var{exclaim\_\hspace{0.3mm}subj} & Indicates whether any exclamation point was included in the email subject.    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Descriptions for 11 variables in the \data{email} data set. Notice that all of the variables are indicator\index{indicator variable} variables, which take the value 1 if the specified characteristic is present and 0 otherwise.}
\label{emailVariables}
\end{table}


\subsection{Modeling the probability of an event}
\label{modelingTheProbabilityOfAnEvent}

\begin{tipBox}{\tipBoxTitle{Notation for a logistic regression model}
The outcome variable for a GLM is denoted by $Y_i$, where the index $i$ is used to represent observation $i$. In the email application, $Y_i$ will be used to represent whether email $i$ is spam ($Y_i=1$) or not ($Y_i=0$). \vspace{3mm}

The predictor variables are represented as follows: $x_{1,i}$ is the value of variable 1 for observation $i$, $x_{2,i}$ is the value of variable 2 for observation $i$, and so on.}
\end{tipBox}

Logistic regression is a generalized linear model where the outcome is a two-level categorical variable. The outcome, $Y_i$, takes the value 1 (in our application, this represents a spam message) with probability $p_i$ and the value 0 with probability $1-p_i$. It~is the probability $p_i$ that we model in relation to the predictor variables.

The logistic regression model relates the probability an email is spam ($p_i$) to the predictors $x_{1,i}$, $x_{2,i}$, ..., $x_{k,i}$ through a framework much like that of multiple regression:
\begin{align}
transformation(p_{i}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1,i} + \beta_2 x_{2,i} + \cdots \beta_k x_{k,i}
\label{linkTransformationEquation}
\end{align}
We want to choose a transformation in Equation~\eqref{linkTransformationEquation} that makes practical and mathematical sense. For example, we want a transformation that makes the range of possibilities on the left hand side of Equation~\eqref{linkTransformationEquation} equal to the range of possibilities for the right hand side; if there was no transformation for this equation, the left hand side could only take values between 0 and 1, but the right hand side could take values outside of this range. A common transformation for $p_i$ is the \term{logit transformation}, which may be written as
\begin{align*}
logit(p_i) = \log_{e}\left( \frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \right)
\end{align*}
The logit transformation is shown in Figure~\ref{logitTransformationFigureHoriz}. Below, we rewrite Equation~\eqref{linkTransformationEquation} using the logit transformation of $p_i$:
\begin{align*}
\log_{e}\left( \frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \right)
	= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1,i} + \beta_2 x_{2,i} + \cdots + \beta_k x_{k,i}
\end{align*}
In our spam example, there are 10 predictor variables, so $k = 10$. This model isn't very intuitive, but it still has some resemblance to multiple regression, and we can fit this model using software. In fact, once we look at results from software, it will start to feel like we're back in multiple regression, even if the interpretation of the coefficients is more complex.

\textC{\newpage}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_regr_mult_and_log/figures/logitTransformationFigureHoriz/logitTransformationFigureHoriz}
\caption{Values of $p_i$ against values of $logit(p_i)$.}
\label{logitTransformationFigureHoriz}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}{Here we create a spam filter with a single predictor: \var{to\_\hspace{0.3mm}multiple}. This variable indicates whether more than one email address was listed in the \emph{To} field of the email. The following logistic regression model was fit using statistical software:
\begin{align*}
\log\left( \frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \right) = -2.12 - 1.81\times\text{\var{to\_\hspace{0.3mm}multiple}}
\end{align*}
%library(openintro); data(email); tm <- email$to_multiple > 0; g <- glm(email$spam ~ tm, family=binomial); summary(g); a <- exp(-2.12); a/(1+a); a <- exp(-2.12-1.81); a/(1+a)
If an email is randomly selected and it has just one address in the \emph{To} field, what is the probability it is spam? What if more than one address is listed in the \emph{To} field?}\label{logisticExampleWithToMultiple}
If there is only one email in the \emph{To} field, then \var{to\_\hspace{0.3mm}multiple} takes value 0 and the right side of the model equation equals -2.12. Solving for $p_i$: $\frac{e^{-2.12}}{1 + e^{-2.12}} = 0.11$. Just as we labeled a fitted value of $y_i$ with a ``hat'' in single-variable and multiple regression, we will do the same for this probability: $\hat{p}_i = 0.11$.

If there is more than one address listed in the \emph{To} field, then the right side of the model equation is $-2.12 - 1.81\times1 = -3.93$, which corresponds to a probability $\hat{p}_i = 0.02$.

Notice that we could examine -2.12 and -3.93 in Figure~\ref{logitTransformationFigureHoriz} to estimate the probability before formally calculating the value.
\end{example}

To convert from values on the regression-scale (e.g. -2.12 and -3.93 in Example~\ref{logisticExampleWithToMultiple}), use the following formula, which is the result of solving for $p_i$ in the regression model:
\begin{align*}
p_i
	= \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1,i}+\cdots+\beta_k x_{k,i}}}
		{\ 1\ \ +\ \ e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1,i}+\cdots+\beta_k x_{k,i}}\ }
\end{align*}
As with most applied data problems, we substitute the point estimates for the parameters (the $\beta_i$) so that we may make use of this formula. In Example~\ref{logisticExampleWithToMultiple}, the probabilities were calculated as
\begin{align*}
&\frac{\ e^{-2.12}\ }{\ 1\ +\ e^{-2.12}\ } = 0.11 && \frac{\ e^{-2.12 - 1.81}\ }{\ 1\ +\ e^{-2.12 - 1.81}\ } = 0.02
\end{align*}
While the information about whether the email is addressed to multiple people is a helpful start in classifying email as spam or not, the probabilities of 11\% and 2\% are not dramatically different, and neither provides very strong evidence about which particular email messages are spam. To get more precise estimates, we'll need to include many more variables in the model.

We used statistical software to fit the logistic regression model with all ten predictors described in Table~\ref{emailVariables}. Like multiple regression, the result may be presented in a summary table, which is shown in Table~\ref{emailLogisticModelResults}. The structure of this table is almost identical to that of multiple regression; the only notable difference is that the p-values are calculated using the normal distribution rather than the $t$-distribution.

Just like multiple regression, we could trim some variables from the model using the p-value. Using backward elimination with a p-value cutoff of 0.05 (start with the full model and trim the predictors with p-values greater than 0.05), we ultimately eliminate the \var{exclaim\_\hspace{0.3mm}subj}, \var{dollar}, \var{inherit}, and \var{cc} predictors.

\begin{exercise}
Examine the summary of the reduced model in Table~\ref{emailLogisticReducedModel}, and in particular, examine the \var{to\_\hspace{0.3mm}multiple} row. Is the point estimate the same as we found before, -1.81, or is it different? Explain why this might be.\footnote{The new estimate is different: -2.87. This new value represents the estimated coefficient when we are also accounting for other variables in the logistic regression model.}
\end{exercise}

Point estimates will generally change a little -- and sometimes a lot -- depending on which other variables are included in the model. This is usually due to colinearity in the predictor variables. We previously saw this in the Ebay auction example when we compared the coefficient of \var{cond\_\hspace{0.3mm}new} in a single-variable model and the corresponding coefficient in the multiple regression model that used three additional variables (see Sections~\ref{twoSingleVariableModelsForMarioKartData} and~\ref{includingAndAssessingManyVariablesInAModel}).

\begin{example}{Spam filters are built to be automated, meaning a piece of software is written to collect information about emails as they arrive, and this information is put in the form of variables. These variables are then put into an algorithm that uses a statistical model, like the one we've fit, to classify the email. Suppose we write software for a spam filter using the reduced model shown in Table~\ref{emailLogisticReducedModel}. If an incoming email has the word ``winner'' in it, will this raise or lower the model's calculated probability that the incoming email is spam?} \label{exampleForSpamAndWinner}
The estimated coefficient of \var{winner} is positive (1.7370). A positive coefficient estimate in logistic regression, just like in multiple regression, corresponds to a positive association between the predictor and response variables when accounting for the other variables in the model. Since the response variable takes value 1 if an email is spam and 0 otherwise, the positive coefficient indicates that the presence of ``winner'' in an email raises the model probability that the message is spam.
\end{example}

\begin{example}{Suppose the same email from Example~\ref{exampleForSpamAndWinner} was in HTML format, meaning the \var{format} variable took value 1. Does this characteristic increase or decrease the probability that the email is spam according to the model?}\label{exampleForSpamAndFormat}
Since HTML corresponds to a value of 1 in the \var{format} variable and the coefficient of this variable is negative (-1.5569), this would lower the probability estimate returned from the model.
\end{example}

\subsection{Practical decisions in the email application}

Examples~\ref{exampleForSpamAndWinner} and~\ref{exampleForSpamAndFormat} highlight a key feature of logistic and multiple regression. In the spam filter example, some email characteristics will push an email's classification in the direction of spam while other characteristics will push it in the opposite direction.

If we were to implement a spam filter using the model we have fit, then each future email we analyze would fall into one of three categories based on the email's characteristics:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The email characteristics generally indicate the email is not spam, and so the resulting probability that the email is spam is quite low, say, under 0.05.
\item The characteristics generally indicate the email is spam, and so the resulting probability that the email is spam is quite large, say, over 0.95.
\item The characteristics roughly balance each other out in terms of evidence for and against the message being classified as spam. Its probability falls in the remaining range, meaning the email cannot be adequately classified as spam or not spam.
\end{enumerate}
If we were managing an email service, we would have to think about what should be done in each of these three instances. In an email application, there are usually just two possibilities: filter the email out from the regular inbox and put it in a ``spambox'', or let the email go to the regular inbox.

\begin{exercise}
The first and second scenarios are intuitive. If the evidence strongly suggests a message is not spam, send it to the inbox. If the evidence strongly suggests the message is spam, send it to the spambox. How should we handle emails in the third category?\footnote{In this particular application, we should err on the side of sending more mail to the inbox rather than mistakenly putting good messages in the spambox. So, in summary: emails in the first and last categories go to the regular inbox, and those in the second scenario go to the spambox.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Suppose we apply the logistic model we have built as a spam filter and that 100 messages are placed in the spambox over 3 months. If we used the guidelines above for putting messages into the spambox, about how many legitimate (non-spam) messages would you expect to find among the 100 messages?\footnote{First, note that we proposed a cutoff for the predicted probability of 0.95 for spam. In a worst case scenario, all the messages in the spambox had the minimum probability equal to about 0.95. Thus, we should expect to find about 5 or fewer legitimate messages among the 100 messages placed in the spambox.}
\end{exercise}

Almost any classifier will have some error. In the spam filter guidelines above, we have decided that it is okay to allow up to 5\% of the messages in the spambox to be real messages. If we wanted to make it a little harder to classify messages as spam, we could use a cutoff of 0.99. This would have two effects. Because it raises the standard for what can be classified as spam, it reduces the number of good emails that are classified as spam. However, it will also fail to correctly classify an increased fraction of spam messages. No matter the complexity and the confidence we might have in our model, these practical considerations are absolutely crucial to making a helpful spam filter. Without them, we could actually do more harm than good by using our statistical model.


\subsection{Diagnostics for the email classifier}

\begin{termBox}{\tBoxTitle{Logistic regression conditions}
There are two key conditions for fitting a logistic regression model: \vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Each predictor $x_i$ is linearly related to logit$(p_i)$ if all other predictors are held constant.
%\item The model relating the parameter $p_i$ to the predictors $x_{1,i}$, $x_{2,i}$, ..., $x_{k,i}$ closely resembles the true relationship between the parameter and the predictors.
\item Each outcome $Y_i$ is independent of the other outcomes.
\end{enumerate}}
\end{termBox}

The first condition of the logistic regression model is not easily checked without a fairly sizable amount of data. Luckily, we have 3,921 emails in our data set! Let's first visualize these data by plotting the true classification of the emails against the model's fitted probabilities, as shown in Figure~\ref{logisticModelPredict}. The vast majority of emails (spam or not) still have fitted probabilities below 0.5.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_regr_mult_and_log/figures/logisticModel/logisticModelPredict}
\caption{The predicted probability that each of the 3,912 emails is spam is classified by their grouping, spam or not. Noise (small, random vertical shifts) have been added to each point so that points with nearly identical values aren't plotted exactly on top of one another. This makes it possible to see more observations.}
\label{logisticModelPredict}
\end{figure}

This may at first seem very discouraging: we have fit a logistic model to create a spam filter, but no emails have a fitted probability of being spam above 0.75. Don't despair; we will discuss ways to improve the model through the use of better variables in Section~\ref{improvingTheSetOfVariablesForASpamFilter}.

We'd like to assess the quality of our model. For example, we might ask: if we look at emails that we modeled as having a 10\% chance of being spam, do we find about 10\% of them actually are spam? To help us out, we'll borrow an advanced statistical method called \term{natural splines} that estimates the local probability over the region 0.00 to 0.75 (the largest predicted probability was 0.73, so we avoid extrapolating). All you need to know about natural splines to understand what we are doing is that they are used to fit flexible lines rather than straight lines.

The curve fit using natural splines is shown in Figure~\ref{logisticModelSpline} as a solid black line. If the logistic model fits well, the curve should closely follow the dashed $y=x$ line. We have added shading to represent the confidence bound for the curved line to clarify what fluctuations might plausibly be due to chance. Even with this confidence bound, there are weaknesses in the first model assumption. The solid curve and its confidence bound dips below the dashed line from about 0.1 to 0.3, and then it drifts above the dashed line from about 0.35 to 0.55. These deviations indicate the model relating the parameter to the predictors does not closely resemble the true relationship.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_regr_mult_and_log/figures/logisticModel/logisticModelSpline}
\caption{The solid black line provides the empirical estimate of the probability for observations based on their predicted probabilities (confidence bounds are also shown for this line), which is fit using natural splines. A small amount of noise was added to the observations in the plot to allow more observations to be seen.}
\label{logisticModelSpline}
\end{figure}

We could evaluate the second logistic regression model assumption -- independence of the outcomes -- using the model residuals. The residuals for a logistic regression model are calculated the same way as with multiple regression: the observed outcome minus the expected outcome. For logistic regression, the expected value of the outcome is the fitted probability for the observation, and the residual may be written as
\begin{align*}
e_i = Y_i - \hat{p}_i
\end{align*}
We could plot these residuals against a variety of variables or in their order of collection, as we did with the residuals in multiple regression. However, since the model will need to be revised to effectively classify spam and you have already seen similar residual plots in Section~\ref{multipleRegressionModelAssumptions}, we won't investigate the residuals here.

\subsection{Improving the set of variables for a spam filter}
\label{improvingTheSetOfVariablesForASpamFilter}

If we were building a spam filter for an email service that managed many accounts (e.g. Gmail or Hotmail), we would spend much more time thinking about additional variables that could be useful in classifying emails as spam or not. We also would use transformations or other techniques that would help us include strongly skewed numerical variables as predictors.

Take a few minutes to think about additional variables that might be useful in identifying spam. Below is a list of variables we think might be useful:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] An indicator variable could be used to represent whether there was prior two-way correspondence with a message's sender. For instance, if you sent a message to john@example.com and then John sent you an email, this variable would take value 1 for the email that John sent. If you had never sent John an email, then the variable would be set to~0.
\item[(2)] A second indicator variable could utilize an account's past spam flagging information. The variable could take value 1 if the sender of the message has previously sent messages flagged as~spam.
\item[(3)] A third indicator variable could flag emails that contain links included in previous spam messages. If such a link is found, then set the variable to~1 for the email. Otherwise, set it to~0.
\end{enumerate}
The variables described above take one of two approaches. Variable (1) is specially designed to capitalize on the fact that spam is rarely sent between individuals that have two-way communication. Variables~(2) and~(3) are specially designed to flag common spammers or spam messages. While we would have to verify using the data that each of the variables is effective, these seem like promising ideas.

Table~\ref{emailTableOfSpamAnd} shows a contingency table for spam and also for the new variable described in~(1) above. If we look at the 1,090 emails where there was correspondence with the sender in the preceding 30 days, not one of these message was spam. This suggests variable~(1) would be very effective at accurately classifying some messages as not spam. With this single variable, we would be able to send about 28\% of messages through to the inbox with confidence that almost none are spam.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}
& \multicolumn{3}{c}{prior correspondence} & \\
\cline{2-4}
 & \ \hspace{5mm}\resp{no} & \ \hspace{8mm}\resp{yes} && \ \hspace{3mm}Total \\
\hline
\vspace{-3.8mm} & & & & \\
\resp{spam} &  367 &    0 &&  367 \\
\resp{not spam}\hspace{3mm}\  & 2464 & 1090 && 3554 \\
\hline
\vspace{-3.8mm} & & & & \\
Total & 2831 & 1090 && 3921 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{A contingency table for \var{spam} and a new variable that represents whether there had been correspondence with the sender in the preceding 30~days.}
\label{emailTableOfSpamAnd}
\end{table}
%library(openintro); data(email); contTable(email[,c("spam", "sent_email")])

The variables described in (2) and (3) would provide an excellent foundation for distinguishing messages coming from known spammers or messages that take a known form of spam. To utilize these variables, we would need to build databases: one holding email addresses of known spammers, and one holding URLs found in known spam messages. Our access to such information is limited, so we cannot implement these two variables in this textbook. However, if we were hired by an email service to build a spam filter, these would be important next steps.

In addition to finding more and better predictors, we would need to create a customized logistic regression model for each email account. This may sound like an intimidating task, but its complexity is not as daunting as it may at first seem. We'll save the details for a statistics course where computer programming plays a more central role.

For what is the extremely challenging task of classifying spam messages, we have made a lot of progress. We have seen that simple email variables, such as the format, inclusion of certain words, and other circumstantial characteristics, provide helpful information for spam classification. Many challenges remain, from better understanding logistic regression to carrying out the necessary computer programming, but completing such a task is very nearly within your reach.

\eoce{\qt{Baby weights, Part I\label{baby_weights_smoke}} The Child Health 
and Development Studies investigate a range of topics. One study 
considered all pregnancies between 1960 and 1967 among women in the 
Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in the San Francisco East Bay area. Here, 
we study the relationship between smoking and weight of the baby. The 
variable \texttt{smoke} is coded 1 if the mother is a smoker, and 0 if 
not. The summary table below shows the results of a linear regression 
model for predicting the average birth weight of babies, measured in 
ounces, based on the smoking status of the mother. \footfullcite{data:babies}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}
  \hline
            & Estimate  & Std. Error  & t value   & Pr($>$$|$t$|$) \\

  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The variability within the smokers and non-smokers are about equal and the 
distributions are symmetric. With these conditions satisfied, it is reasonable 
to apply the model. (Note that we don't need to check linearity since the 
predictor has only two levels.)

\item Write the equation of the regression line.
\item Interpret the slope in this context, and calculate the predicted birth 
weight of babies born to smoker and non-smoker mothers.

child is the first born, and 1 otherwise. The summary table below shows the 
results of a linear regression model for predicting the average birth weight 
of babies, measured in ounces, from \texttt{parity}.

weights is to consider all possibly related variables at once. Other variables 
of interest include length of pregnancy in days (\texttt{gestation}), mother's 
age in years (\texttt{age}), mother's height in inches (\texttt{height}), and

equal to the volume of a tree, however, this value is difficult to measure

watch, and rate highly, the movies recommended to them. Should the company use 
the adjusted $R^2$ or the p-value approach in selecting
variables for their recommendation system?

\eoce{\qt{Possum classification, Part I\label{possum_classification_model_select}} 
The common brushtail possum of the Australia region is a bit cuter than its 
distant cousin, the American opossum (see Figure~\vref{brushtail_possum}). We 
consider 104 brushtail possums from two regions in Australia, where the 
possums may be considered a random sample from the population. The first 
region is Victoria, which is in the eastern half of Australia and traverses 
the southern coast. The second region consists of New South Wales and 
Queensland, which make up eastern and northeastern Australia.

We use logistic regression to differentiate between possums in these two 
regions. The outcome variable, called \var{population}, takes value 1 when a 
possum is from Victoria and 0 when it is from New South Wales or Queensland. 
We consider five predictors: \var{sex\_\hspace{0.3mm}male} (an indicator for a 
possum being male), \var{head\_\hspace{0.3mm}length}, 
\var{skull\_\hspace{0.3mm}width}, \var{total\_\hspace{0.3mm}length}, and 
\var{tail\_\hspace{0.3mm}length}. Each variable is summarized in a histogram. 
The full logistic regression model and a reduced model after variable 
selection are summarized in the table.

\eoce{\qt{Challenger disaster, Part I\label{challenger_disaster_model_select}} 
On January 28, 1986, a routine launch was anticipated for the Challenger space 
shuttle. Seventy-three seconds into the flight, disaster happened: the shuttle 
broke apart, killing all seven crew members on board. An investigation into 
the cause of the disaster focused on a critical seal called an O-ring, and it 
is believed that damage to these O-rings during a shuttle launch may be 
related to the ambient temperature during the launch. The table below 
summarizes observational data on O-rings for 23 shuttle missions, where the 
mission order is based on the temperature at the time of the launch. 
\emph{Temp} gives the temperature in Fahrenheit, \emph{Damaged} represents the 
number of damaged O-rings, and \emph{Undamaged} represents the number of
O-rings that were not damaged.

\eoce{\qt{Challenger disaster, Part II\label{challenger_disaster_predict}} 
Exercise~\ref{challenger_disaster_model_select} introduced us to O-rings that 
were identified as a plausible explanation for the breakup of the Challenger 
space shuttle 73 seconds into takeoff in 1986. The investigation found that 
the ambient temperature at the time of the shuttle launch was closely related 
to the damage of O-rings, which are a critical component of the shuttle. See 
this earlier exercise if you would like to browse the original data.

\begin{parts}
\item The data provided in the previous exercise are shown in the plot. The 
logistic model fit to these data may be written as
\begin{align*}
\log\left( \frac{\hat{p}}{1 - \hat{p}} \right) = 11.6630 - 0.2162\times Temperature
\end{align*}
where $\hat{p}$ is the model-estimated probability that an O-ring will become 
damaged. Use the model to calculate the probability that an O-ring will become 
damaged at each of the following ambient temperatures: 51, 53, and 55 degrees 
Fahrenheit. The model-estimated probabilities for several additional ambient 
temperatures are provided below, where subscripts indicate the temperature:
\begin{align*}
&\hat{p}_{57} = 0.341
	&& \hat{p}_{59} = 0.251
	&& \hat{p}_{61} = 0.179
	&& \hat{p}_{63} = 0.124 \\
&\hat{p}_{65} = 0.084
	&& \hat{p}_{67} = 0.056
	&& \hat{p}_{69} = 0.037
	&& \hat{p}_{71} = 0.024
\end{align*}
\item Add the model-estimated probabilities from part~(a) on the plot, then 
connect these dots using a smooth curve to represent the model-estimated 
probabilities.
\item Describe any concerns you may have regarding applying logistic 
regression in this application, and note any assumptions that are required to 
accept the model's validity.
